Yes, you can have multiple workspaces of the same product that is part of our CAKE.com Suite and with different subscription plans.

An organization can have multiple workspaces, and each workspace can have its own subscription plan. This flexibility allows organizations to create their subscription plans based on the needs of different teams or departments within the same organization.

For example, in your organization:

* **Workspace 1 (Clockify)** could be on a **Free** plan.
* **Workspace 2 (Clockify)** could be on a **Pro** plan.
* **Workspace 3 (Clockify)** could be on an **Enterp


## Chunk 13

Clockify)** could be on a **Free** plan.
* **Workspace 2 (Clockify)** could be on a **Pro** plan.
* **Workspace 3 (Clockify)** could be on an **Enterprise** plan.

Each workspace is treated as a separate entity regarding subscriptions, meaning each one can independently subscribe to different plans. However, it’s important to note that if your organization subscribes to a **Bundle** plan (covering multiple products), the Bundle subscription will replace the individual subscriptions for the products included in the Bundle. The Bundle would then apply to all workspaces for those products.If you manage multiple workspaces with different subscription plans, you can view and manage each workspace’s subscription through the **Subscription page** in your CAKE.com Account. This is a centralized place where you can see all subscriptions, modify them, and any other details.

I am a member of 3 paid workspaces in one Organization and they charge my seat for all 3. Why?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are a member of 3 paid workspaces within the same organization, you are charged for each workspace because **each workspace has its own subscription**. Even though you are the same user, each workspace you belong to requires a separate seat for billing purposes.

Therefore, if each workspace is on a paid plan, you will be


## Chunk 14

e same user, each workspace you belong to requires a separate seat for billing purposes.

Therefore, if each workspace is on a paid plan, you will be charged for a seat in each workspace, even if you are the same person. So, if you are part of 3 different workspaces, each on a paid plan, you’ll be charged 3 separate times, one for each workspace’s seat. Check out this article for more information about bundle seats, and these articles for more information about seats on individual subscriptions of each product: Clockify, Pumble, Plaky.

This billing structure is how the system manages subscriptions for individual workspaces, and customer information is shared across all products within the organization. Check out this article for more information on how to manage subscriptions.

# Individual Subscription - CAKE.com Help Center


## Chunk 1

Individual Subscription
=======================

Each CAKE.com app offers a free version with its core features, but you can unlock premium functionalities by upgrading to a paid subscription. If you only need a paid subscription in one or two apps, and not the whole CAKE.com Bundle, purchasing individual subscriptions are a way to go.

Each app has multiple subscription options, which can be purchased directly from the app. Check out these articles to learn more about purchasing subscription plans in each individual app:

Individual subscription plans are specific to a single app and apply to one workspace within that app where the subscription is purchased. For example, within the same organization, you can have multiple workspaces in one app, each with its own subscription plan (e.g. an organization with two Clockify workspaces, one on basic and other on Enterprise plan).

Since the organization owner is also the owner of each workspace within the organization, when subscribing to a paid plan, the owner seat is charged in each workspace subscribed to a paid plan.

Individual subscriptions are managed from the app they are purchased in.

*If you’re looking to use Enterprise plans across all CAKE.com apps, the **Bundle subscription plan** is the ideal choice. It provides a comprehensive solution for accessing premium features on every app.*

* Organization level
* Product level

Organization-level roles
------------------------

At the organization level, there are two primary roles:

1. **Owner**: The owner is the highest level role within the CAKE.com organization. They have the authority to manage organizations, access all information, and grant permissions for all features and actions. While an organization can only have one owner, that owner can create multiple organizations. Also, ownership can be transferred from one organization member to another.

2. **Member**: Members are regular users within the organization. They have permissions limited to modifying content in the workspaces they are in and modifying their account.

Please note that while there **isn’t** a specific role called **Organization admin**, certain workspace roles, like a **Workspace admin**, may have additional permissions on the organization level, such as managing bundle payments. Multiple workspace admins from different workspaces can exist within one organization.

es can exist within one organization.

Workspace owner role has the same permissions as Organization owner, though individual Help centers may refer to it as the Workspace owner. Only a Workspace owner can create a new workspace. If a Workspace admin wishes to create one, new organization must be created, with the Workspace admin assuming the Workspace owner role in that organization.

To help you understand these roles better, check out the table below with comprehensive list of access permissions within the CAKE.com organization, categorized based on user roles and levels.

You can find this list in the table below:

# Transfer Ownership - CAKE.com Help Center


## Chunk 1

Transfer Ownership
==================

CAKE.com Productivity Suite allows users to transfer ownership of the organization to another person, at any time. The organization owner can choose any active user across the organization’s workspaces as the new owner.

Only the organization owner has full control over user management and the ability to transfer ownership. Workspace admins and other members will not have access to this functionality. Therefore, be sure to review the details before confirming the transfer.

This guide will walk you through the steps and requirements about transferring ownership.

How to transfer ownership
-------------------------

To transfer ownership:

1. Navigate to the **Members** page
2. Choose new owner
3. Click on three dots to open the user management menu
4. Select **Transfer ownership**

   Confirmation pop-up appears that provides an overview of the changes that will take place. You need to confirm it before you can proceed
5. Click to confirm the action

![](https://cake.com/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-30-at-11.08.53-1.png)

Ownership transfer can only be done at the organization level. This option is not available on the product or the workspace level. You won’t be able to transfer ownership from the Clockify/Pumble/Plaky side. User you’re transferring ownership to must have an active account in all the workspaces withi

transfer ownership from the Clockify/Pumble/Plaky side. User you’re transferring ownership to must have an active account in all the workspaces within the organization.

After transfer:

* After the ownership transfer, the current owner is downgraded to a workspace admin, and their permissions are reduced accordingly. The new owner has full access to user management and can view, modify, and export all user data.
* Only the organization owner has the ability to search and manage user profiles. Workspace admins or regular organization members cannot access the **Members** page.

Troubleshooting
---------------

If the transfer process in taking longer than expected, a loader will appear. You can choose to cancel the action if needed.

So, if your organization is undergoing restructuring or you’re merging teams, follow the steps below to complete a successful workspace transfer.

Permissions and roles
---------------------

To perform the transfer, you must be the owner or have equivalent permissions in both the source and destination organizations. Learn more about owner role in CAKE.com.

**Organization Owner**:

* Responsible for initiating and authorizing the transfer
* Must have full access to both the source and destination organizations

7. Click **Confirm** to complete the transfer

Prior to initiating the transfer, review the transfer details, including the workspace name, destination organization, and any relevant settings or data changes. Pay attention to any notifications or warnings, especially if both organizations are on the Free plan, since different processes or limitations may apply.

All users will be logged out during this process. Once the process is completed, the owner will receive an email notification confirming the completion and the users will need to log back in to access the workspace in the n

pleted, the owner will receive an email notification confirming the completion and the users will need to log back in to access the workspace in the new organization.
Inform your team about this temporary interruption to ensure they are prepared.

Please note that workspace transfer procedures may vary depending on the subscription plan of the origin and destination organizations.

Troubleshooting
---------------

### Transfer failed

If the transfer is unsuccessful, verify that you have the necessary permissions and retry the process. For persistent issues, consult the CAKE.com support team for assistance.

### Missing data

If you notice any missing data post-transfer, check your backups and restore any lost information if necessary. Contact support for advanced data recovery options if required.

Important considerations
------------------------

* All users will be automatically logged out during the transfer. Inform your team in advance to minimize disruption.
* All your workspace settings, data and user permissions remain unchanged after the transfer
* The transfer may impact tax and currency settings based on the configuration of the destination organization. Review and update your customer information to ensure compliance and avoid future issues.

### Currency and tax changes after transfer

and avoid future issues.

### Currency and tax changes after transfer

When you transfer a workspace, its tax and currency settings might change to match the one in the destination organization. This means that the **Customer information** (like their **Country**/**State**) originally set up in the **source organization** for that workspace, will be replaced by the **Customer information** from the **destination organization** after the transfer.
So, after the transfer, the subscription cost will be displayed in the currency based on the country/state selected in the destination organization’s customer info:

Example:

*Let’s say your current workspace (in Organization A) has Country/State in Customer info set in Oregon, USA. In that case, the subscription costs are displayed in USD.
If you transfer this workspace to Organization B and Organization B’s Country/State in Customer info is set in Switzerland, then after the transfer, your workspace subscription costs will be displayed in CHF.*

# Abonnement und Abrechnung für deinen Arbeitsbereich verwalten - Clockify-Hilfe


## Chunk 1

Als Arbeitsbereich-Administrator oder -Besitzer ist die Verwaltung der Abonnement- und Abrechnungseinstellungen deines Arbeitsbereiches entscheidend, um auf kostenpflichtige Funktionen zugreifen zu können und sicherzustellen, dass die Bedürfnisse deines Teams erfüllt werden. In diesem Leitfaden führen wir dich durch den Prozess der Abonnementverwaltung, des Upgrades oder Downgrades von Abonnements und des Verständnisses von Abrechnungszyklen und Benutzerplätzen.

Hauptbegriffe #
---------------

Bevor wir in die Abonnementverwaltung eintauchen, ist es wichtig, einige Hauptbegriffe kennen zu lernen:

* **Benutzerplätze**: Jeder aktive Benutzer in einem Arbeitsbereich belegt einen “Benutzerplatz”. Die Abrechnung erfolgt basierend auf der Anzahl der aktiven Plätze in deinem Workspace, unabhängig von der Rolle des Benutzers oder den genutzten Funktionen.
* **Bundle-Plätze**: Wenn du die CAKE.com-Produktivitätssuite abonniert hast, hast du möglicherweise zusätzliche Bundle-Plätze über verschiedene Apps hinweg (Clockify, Pumble, Plaky)
* **Volle und Eingeschränkte Benutzer**:
  + **Volle Benutzer**: Teammitglieder mit vollständigem Zugriff auf den Arbeitsbereich
  + **Eingeschränkte Benutzer**: Teammitglieder mit eingeschränktem Zugriff, hauptsächlich zum Einstempeln und Ausstempeln. Für diese Benutzer können zusätzliche Gebühren anfallen.

Abrechnung und Benutzerplätze #

, hauptsächlich zum Einstempeln und Ausstempeln. Für diese Benutzer können zusätzliche Gebühren anfallen.

Abrechnung und Benutzerplätze #
-------------------------------

### Übersicht #

* Du wirst für die Gesamtzahl der **aktiven** Benutzerplätze in deinem Workspace belastet, unabhängig davon, ob diese die Funktionen aktiv nutzen
* Wenn ein Benutzer **deaktiviert** wird, kannst du dessen Platz freigeben und einen anderen Benutzer einladen, ihn einzunehmen
* Du musst für jeden aktiven Benutzer in deinem Arbeitsbereich einen Platz kaufen

### Benutzerplätze verwalten #

Stelle sicher, dass du über ausreichend Benutzerplätze verfügst.

* Wenn dir die verfügbaren Plätze ausgehen, kannst du weitere über die **Abonnementseite** kaufen.
* Freie Plätze können entfernt werden, aber einmal entfernt, können sie nicht erstattet werden.

Nur Arbeitsbereich-Besitzer und Administratoren können Abonnements sowie das Hinzufügen und Entfernen von Benutzerplätzen verwalten.

Abonnementseite navigieren #
----------------------------

Deine **Abonnementseite** ist der zentrale Ort, an dem du alle abrechnungsrelevanten Einstellungen verwaltest. Dazu gehören dein aktueller Plan, deine Benutzerplätze und deine Zahlungsinformationen.

Die Seite ist in drei wichtige Tabs unterteilt:

* **Abrechnung**:
  + Hier siehst du deinen aktuellen Abonnementplan, die Anzahl der genutzten im Vergleich zu den ver

  + Du kannst Rechnungen für deine Unterlagen herunterladen
* **Abonnementpläne**:

### Wechsel zwischen Abrechnungsintervallen #

Du kannst jederzeit auf der **Abonnementseite** zwischen monatlicher und jährlicher Abrechnung wechseln:

* **Jährlich zu monatlich**: Der Wechsel erfolgt nach Ablauf des aktuellen Jahres
* **Monatlich zu jährlich**: Dir wird ein anteiliger Preis berechnet, der die verbleibende Zeit deines aktuellen Plans berücksichtigt

## Chunk 1

Erlebe mehr Kontrolle mit kostenpflichtigen Funktionen von Clockify. Abonniere jetzt und definiere das Erlebnis der Zeiterfassung neu. Entscheide dich für den Abonnementplan, der dir am besten passt und pro Benutzerplatz berechnet wird. Verwandle deinen Arbeitsbereich in eine erweiterte Umgebung.

Vor einem Upgrade solltest du sicherstellen, dass du in einem Arbeitsbereich angemeldet bist.

Das Upgrade wird pro Anzahl von aktiven Teammitgliedern berechnet, egal welche Rolle ihnen zugewiesen wurde oder welche Funktionen sie verwenden.

Hauptbegriffe #
---------------

Lerne Hauptbegriffe und Prozesse in Clockify rund um das Thema Upgrades und Abonnements kennen.

### Abrechnung und Benutzerplätze #

Bitte beachte, dass in jedem Abrechnungszyklus die **gesamte Anzahl** der Benutzerplätze in Rechnung gestellt werden. Deshalb, wenn du über mehr Benutzerplätze als aktive Benutzer im Arbeitsbereich verfügst, werden **alle Benutzerplätze** in Rechnung gestellt, egal ob sie benutzt werden oder nicht.

Du musst nur einen Benutzerplatz für einen aktiven Benutzer in deinem Arbeitsbereich erwerben. Falls ein Benutzer deaktiviert wird, solltest du seinen Platz auf der **Abonnement**-Seite manuell entfernen. Aktive Benutzer sind benutzte Plätze und die Gesamtanzahl der Benutzerplätze ist die Anzahl der in diesem Arbeitsbereich verfügbaren Benutzerplätze.

Beispiel: *Du hast eine jährliche Li


## Chunk 2

und die Gesamtanzahl der Benutzerplätze ist die Anzahl der in diesem Arbeitsbereich verfügbaren Benutzerplätze.

Beispiel: *Du hast eine jährliche Lizenz für zwei Benutzerplätze gezahlt. Du hattest zwei aktive Benutzer für einige Monate und dann hast du einen deaktiviert. Jetzt hast du einen freien Benutzerplatz und kannst neue Benutzer einladen, die diesen Platz besetzen. Jedes Mal, wenn du einen Benutzer deaktivierst, gibst du seinen Platz frei.*

### Benutzerplätze #

Benutzerplätze stehen für die Anzahl von aktiven Nutzern, die du in deinem Arbeitsbereich haben kannst. Wenn du einen kostenpflichtigen Plan zum ersten Mal abonnierst, musst du einen Platz für jeden aktiven Nutzer kaufen. Es gibt auch die Möglichkeit, weitere Benutzerplätze zu erwerben, wenn du vorhast, weitere Benutzer später einzuladen.

### Bundle-Benutzerplätze #

Die Bundle-Benutzerplätze sind die Anzahl der aktiven Mitglieder in Clockify-, Pumble- und Plaky-Arbeitsbereichen, die im Bundle-Abonnementplan in der CAKE.com -Produktivitätssuite erworben werden.

Ausführliche Anweisungen zur Verwaltung von Benutzerplätzen im Kombipaket findest du im Artikel Bundle-Benutzerplätze.

itsbereich beitreten oder eingeladen sind, egal welche Rolle ihnen zugewiesen wurde und welche Funktionen sie verwenden.
Jedes Mal, wenn du einen Mitarbeiter zu deinem Arbeitsbereich einlädst oder wenn sie einem beitreten, wird ihnen ein Benutzerplatz zugewiesen. Wenn es keine verfügbaren Plätze mehr gibt, kannst du keine Benutzer einladen und sie können deinem Arbeitsbereich nicht beitreten.

### Volle und Eingeschränkte Benutzer #

Bei der Verwendung von Kiosk kannst du auf zwei Benutzertypen stoßen: Vollbenutzer und Eingeschränkte Benutzer. Die Vollbenutzer sind Teammitglieder bei einem aktivierten Kiosk, während die eingeschränkten Benutzer über einen eingeschränkten Zugriff verfügen und sich nur an-/abmelden können.
Wenn du eingeschränkte Benutzer zu deinem Arbeitsbereich hinzufügen möchtest, wird dies separat abgerechnet.

Benutzerplätze verwalten #
--------------------------

Wenn alle verfügbaren Benutzerplätze in deinem Arbeitsbereich vergeben sind, kannst du weitere Benutzer hinzufügen, indem du zusätzliche Benutzerplätze in der App auf der Seite **Abonnement** erwirbst.

Nur Besitzer/Admins eines Arbeitsbereichs können Abonnements verwalten und Benutzerplätze hinzufügen und entfernen.

### Clockify-Abonnementseite #

# Abwesenheitsrichtlinien und Ansprüche verstehen - Clockify-Hilfe


## Chunk 1

Clockify ermöglicht dir die Verwaltung der Abwesenheiten deiner Mitarbeiter durch flexible Abwesenheitsrichtlinien und Feiertagsregelungen. Dieser Leitfaden erklärt die Funktionsweise – von der Anspruchsberechnung und den Salden bis hin zur Richtlinienstruktur und Anpassung.

Abwesenheitsanträge sind mit Richtlinien verknüpft #
----------------------------------------------------

Um eine Abwesenheit zu beantragen, muss einem Benutzer eine Abwesenheitsrichtlinie zugewiesen sein. Jede Richtlinie legt fest, ob:

* Eine Genehmigung erforderlich ist
* Zeiteinträge automatisch erstellt werden
* Die Anspruchsberechnung aktiviert ist
* Negative Salden zulässig sind
* Der Benutzer halbe Tage nehmen kann
* Die Zeit in Tagen oder Stunden gemessen wird

Funktionsweise der Genehmigungen #
----------------------------------

Abwesenheitsgenehmigungen gelten nur für Abwesenheitsrichtlinien, nicht für Feiertagsregelungen.

Du kannst festlegen, ob Abwesenheitsanträge eine Genehmigung erfordern:

* **Wenn deaktiviert**: Abwesenheitsanträge werden automatisch genehmigt
* **Wenn aktiviert**: Anträge müssen von zugewiesenen Benutzern geprüft und genehmigt werden

Wer kann Abwesenheitsanträge genehmigen? #
------------------------------------------

Bei der Einrichtung einer Abwesenheitsrichtlinie hast du drei Optionen:

* **Administratoren**
  + Nur Administratoren können Abwesenheitsanträge geneh


## Chunk 2

ei der Einrichtung einer Abwesenheitsrichtlinie hast du drei Optionen:

* **Administratoren**
  + Nur Administratoren können Abwesenheitsanträge genehmigen
  + Administratoren erhalten Benachrichtigungen und sehen alle ausstehenden Anträge im gesamten Arbeitsbereich

* **Teammanager**
  + Nur Teammanager können Anträge der Mitarbeiter genehmigen, die sie verwalten
  + Administratoren werden nicht benachrichtigt, es sei denn, sie sind zusätzlich als Teammanager zugewiesen. Sie können jedoch weiterhin alle Anträge einsehen

Wenn Administratoren ebenfalls Benachrichtigungen erhalten möchten, müssen sie den entsprechenden Benutzern oder Teams als **Teammanager** hinzugefügt werden.

* **Spezifische Mitglieder**
  + Du kannst spezifische Mitglieder (aus deinem gesamten Clockify-Team) als Genehmiger auswählen
  + Ausgewählte Mitglieder erhalten Benachrichtigungen und sind zur Genehmigung von Abwesenheiten berechtigt

Funktionsweise der Anspruchsberechnung #
----------------------------------------

Die Anspruchsberechnung ist optional und gilt nur für Abwesenheitsrichtlinien, nicht für Feiertagsregelungen.

Wenn die Anspruchsberechnung aktiviert ist, kannst du festlegen, wie viel Abwesenheitszeit ein Benutzer im Laufe der Zeit erwirbt.

Du kannst wählen, ob der Anspruch angesammelt wird:

* Monatlich (z. B. 1,5 Tage/Monat)
* Jährlich (z. B. 18 Tage/Jahr)

Wann wird die Zeit gutgeschr


## Chunk 3

Du kannst wählen, ob der Anspruch angesammelt wird:

* Monatlich (z. B. 1,5 Tage/Monat)
* Jährlich (z. B. 18 Tage/Jahr)

Wann wird die Zeit gutgeschrieben?

* Monthly accruals are added on  the 1st of every month
* Jährliche Ansprüche werden am 1. Januar gutgeschrieben

Können Bruchteile gutgeschrieben werden?

Ja, du bist nicht auf volle Tage beschränkt. Du kannst Dezimalwerte verwenden, wie zum Beispiel:

* 0,01 Tage pro Monat (für sehr feingranulare Einstellungen)
* 0,05, 1,25 oder jeden anderen benötigten Wert

Eine Richtlinie gilt für alle zugewiesenen Benutzer #
-----------------------------------------------------

Alle Benutzer, denen dieselbe Richtlinie zugewiesen wurde, teilen sich dieselben Regeln, darunter:

* Anspruchsrate
* Genehmigungserfordernisse
* Zulässige Zeiteinheiten (Tage/Stunden)

Wenn deine Teammitglieder unterschiedliche Regeln zur Anspruchsberechnung haben, zum Beispiel:

* ein Mitarbeiter erwirbt 2 Tage/Jahr,
* ein anderer erwirbt 5 Tage/Jahr,

erstelle separate Richtlinien für jede Gruppe oder Einzelperson.

Abwesenheitszeit kann in Tagen oder Stunden erfasst werden #
------------------------------------------------------------

Du kannst für jede Richtlinie die verwendete Zeiteinheit wählen:

* Tage (standardmäßig)
* Stunden

Dies gilt auch für die Anspruchsberechnung. Wenn du eine stundenbasierte Richtlinie verwendest, kannst du Stunden pro Monat


## Chunk 4

(standardmäßig)
* Stunden

Dies gilt auch für die Anspruchsberechnung. Wenn du eine stundenbasierte Richtlinie verwendest, kannst du Stunden pro Monat oder pro Jahr erwerben, genau wie bei Tagen.

# Accrue time off - Clockify Help


## Chunk 1

Time off is a paid feature, which you can enable by upgrading your workspace to Standard, Pro, or Enterprise plan.

Use the **Balance** tab to track the days you’ve accrued for time off. See how much time off each member has for each policy, how much they’ve used up, and the detailed log of changes in their balance history.

Manage accruals #
-----------------

You can view balance by policy (e.g. vacation balance for each team member) or by user (e.g. balance for each policy for a specific user).

Regular users can see balance history only for their own policies, admins can see everyone’s, and team managers can see their team members’:

* Accrued – how many days or hours a person received
* Used – how many days or hours a person used up by requesting time off
* Available – how many days or hours a person has left which they can use when requesting time off (accrued minus used)

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Screenshot-2025-09-15-at-18.05.51-1024x494.png)

Before people can take time off, you first need to give them days (or hours), which they can use up when requesting time off:

* If a person doesn’t have any time accrued, you can set initial balance by clicking **Add** next to their name
* You can add or remove accrual days/hours by clicking on the three dots (and leave a comment why the person received or lost time off)
* When adding days/hours you


## Chunk 2

or remove accrual days/hours by clicking on the three dots (and leave a comment why the person received or lost time off)
* When adding days/hours you need to define a **validity period** (a start and end date) to any time off balance. This means the balance will expire and be automatically removed after the set date.
* You can add or remove days/hours in bulk when you view balance grouped by policy, and then check for which users you wish to add/remove time off

When admin adds or removes time off manually, the accrued columns are updated.

When a person’s balance is manually updated (via add or remove), they and their team manager will receive an email.

Balance history #
-----------------

If you need to know why a certain person has X number of days, you can click on the three dots and click History.

* Regular users can see only their own balance, as well as balance history.
* Admins can see balance for each person, as well as add or remove accrued days/hours.
* Team managers can see balance and balance history for all their members, but can’t edit it.

Balance history lists all the time off requests a person made, their status, and changes to their accrual: you can see what was changed, when, and who made it:

* Pending and approved requests remove time from the balance
* Rejected and withdrawn requests add back the original time to the balance
* Admin’s manual action can


## Chunk 3

approved requests remove time from the balance
* Rejected and withdrawn requests add back the original time to the balance
* Admin’s manual action can add or remove from accrued balance (e.g. a member receives days off when a new period starts, or they work overtime and receive time in lieu)

# Accumulation des congés - Aide Clockify


## Chunk 1

Les congés sont une fonctionnalité payante, que vous pouvez activer en mettant à niveau votre espace de travail vers le plan Standard, Pro ou Enterprise.

Utilisez l'onglet **Solde** pour suivre les jours de congé que vous avez accumulés. Découvrez le nombre de jours de congé dont dispose chaque membre pour chaque contrat, le nombre de jours qu'il a utilisés et le journal détaillé des modifications apportées à l'historique de son solde.

Gérer les accumulations #
-------------------------

Vous pouvez consulter le solde par politique (par exemple, le solde des vacances de chaque membre de l'équipe) ou par utilisateur (par exemple, le solde de chaque politique pour un utilisateur spécifique).

Les utilisateurs réguliers ne peuvent consulter l'historique des soldes que pour leurs propres politiques, les administrateurs peuvent voir ceux de tout le monde et les chefs d'équipe peuvent voir ceux des membres de leur équipe :

* Accumulé – combien de jours ou d'heures une personne a reçu
* Utilisé – nombre de jours ou d'heures qu'une personne a utilisés en demandant des congés
* Disponible – nombre de jours ou d'heures qu'il reste à une personne et qu'elle peut utiliser pour demander des congés (accumulés moins utilisés)

Avant que les personnes puissent prendre des congés, vous devez d'abord leur donner des jours (ou des heures), qu'elles peuvent utiliser lorsqu'elles demandent du temps libre :

* If a person doesn’t have any time accrued, you can set initial balance by clicking **Add** next to their name
* Vous pouvez ajouter ou supprimer des jours/heures d'accumulation en cliquant sur les trois points (et laisser un commentaire expliquant pourquoi la personne a reçu ou perdu du temps libre)
* When adding days/hours you need to define a **validity period** (a start and end date) to any time off balance. This means the balance will expire and be automatically removed after the set date.
* Vous pouvez ajouter ou supprimer des jours/heures en vrac lorsque vous visualisez le solde groupé par politique, puis vérifier pour quels utilisateurs vous souhaitez ajouter/supprimer du temps libre

Lorsque l'administrateur ajoute ou supprime manuellement des congés, les colonnes des congés accumulés sont mises à jour.

Lorsque le solde d'une personne est mis à jour manuellement (par ajout ou suppression), cette personne et son chef d'équipe reçoivent un email.

* Les administrateurs peuvent voir le solde de chaque personne, ainsi qu'ajouter ou supprimer des jours/heures accumulés.
* Les chefs d'équipe peuvent voir le solde et l'historique du solde de tous leurs membres, mais ne peuvent pas le modifier.

L'historique du solde répertorie toutes les demandes de congé faites par une personne, leur statut et les modifications apportées à leur solde, vous pouvez voir ce qui a été modifié, quand et qui l'a fait :

* Les demandes en attente et approuvées retirent du temps du solde
* Les demandes rejetées et retirées ajoutent le temps original au solde
* Une action manuelle de l'administrateur peut ajouter ou supprimer du solde accumulé (par exemple, un membre reçoit des jours de congé lorsqu'une nouvelle période commence, ou il fait des heures supplémentaires et reçoit du temps en remplacement).

# Acompanhar o progresso e estimativas no Clockify


## Chunk 1

Para acompanhar o progresso do projeto no Clockify, defina estimativas e orçamento e, em seguida, compare o estimado com o rastreado na guia Status do projeto.

Para obter uma orientação geral sobre projetos, assista ao vídeo e siga as instruções abaixo.

A interface do usuário exibida neste vídeo pode não corresponder à versão mais recente do aplicativo.

Estimativas #
-------------

Você pode estimar a duração de um projeto e, em seguida, acompanhar o andamento e comparar o tempo estimado com o tempo rastreado para ver como você e sua equipe estão progredindo.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-26-at-11.02.52-1024x505.png)

As estimativas são úteis porque permitem que você veja se cobra o suficiente para os projetos. Além disso, as estimativas podem ajudar você a melhorar sua capacidade de estimar projetos futuros.

Por exemplo, quando você compara o tempo estimado com o tempo realmente monitorado em um projeto, você tem uma noção melhor de quanto tempo um projeto como esse leva, o que ajuda a dar melhores orçamentos aos clientes e definir melhores orçamentos.

Existem dois **tipos de estimativas** no Clockify:

* Estimativa manual (para todo o projeto)
* Estimativa baseada em tarefas

Para definir uma estimativa para todo o projeto, vá para a guia Configurações desse projeto, selecione Estimativa de tempo e digite sua estimativa de ho


## Chunk 2

ra definir uma estimativa para todo o projeto, vá para a guia Configurações desse projeto, selecione Estimativa de tempo e digite sua estimativa de horas depois de selecionar **Manual**.

Outra opção é definir estimativas para as tarefas selecionando a estimativa **Baseada em tarefas**. Em seguida, o campo de estimativa aparecerá para cada tarefa na página Tarefa do projeto, e a estimativa total do projeto será uma soma de todas as estimativas de tarefas individuais.

Se você tiver projetos de taxa fixa, poderá definir estimativas em valores monetários usando orçamento do projeto.

Status do projeto #
-------------------

Quando você e sua equipe começarem a controlar o tempo de projetos e tarefas, poderão acompanhar o andamento de cada projeto usando o status do projeto.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-29-at-15.20.26-1024x540.png)

Cada projeto mostrará um status próximo a ele, por exemplo, 15 (de 25 horas), o que significa que você estimou 25 horas e sua equipe registrou 15 horas.

Você pode obter mais detalhes sobre o status do projeto clicando no ícone da barra ou na guia Status do projeto.

O estado do projeto permite que você veja o progresso rapidamente. Você pode ver:

* O tempo total rastreado e o que é faturável
* Quanto você ganhou em um projeto
* A classificação do tempo para cada tarefa (responsável, estimativa, quanto di


## Chunk 3

total rastreado e o que é faturável
* Quanto você ganhou em um projeto
* A classificação do tempo para cada tarefa (responsável, estimativa, quanto disso foi registrado e quanto dinheiro você ganhou em cada tarefa)

Na tabela de tarefas, você pode classificar as colunas de tarefas clicando na coluna pela qual deseja classificá-las. Você também pode ocultar tarefas concluídas selecionando **Mostrar ativo** no filtro de tarefas no canto superior direito da tabela.

**Administradores** podem visualizar o status de todos os projetos. **Gerentes de projeto** sempre podem ver o status dos projetos que gerenciam. **Usuários comuns** podem ver o status de seus projetos, a menos que você desative essa opção nas configurações do espaço de trabalho.

Estimativas em relatórios #
---------------------------

Você também pode ver e exportar estimativas no Relatório Resumido, juntamente com o tempo monitorado.

Para ver estimativas, alterne a opção **Mostrar estimativas** e você verá a coluna de estimativas quando tiver o relatório agrupado por projeto ou tarefa.

## Chunk 4

Quando estiver na página de Projetos ou na página de status de algum projeto individual, você pode obter uma boa visualização para impressão acessando as opções do seu navegador e clicando em Imprimir (ou pressionando Ctrl/Cmd+P).

Quando estiver no modo de impressão do navegador, você tem a opção de salvar a página como PDF.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/project-status-print11-1024x702.png)

Além de exportar o status do projeto em formato PDF, você também pode exportar todos os seus projetos e dados relacionados da página **Projetos** como arquivos CSV ou Excel.

# Acumular folga / Banco de férias


## Chunk 1

Acumular folga / Banco de férias
================================

A folga é uma ferramenta paga, que você pode ativar atualizando seu espaço de trabalho para o plano Standard, Pro ou Enterprise.

Use a guia **Saldo** para acompanhar os dias que você acumulou para folga. Veja quanto tempo de folga cada membro tem para cada apólice, quanto eles usaram e o registro detalhado de alterações em seu histórico de saldo.

Gerenciar acumulações #
-----------------------

Você pode visualizar o saldo por política (ex.: saldo de férias para cada integrante da equipe) ou por pessoa (ex.: saldo para cada política de um usuário específico).

Os usuários regulares podem ver o histórico de saldo apenas para suas próprias políticas, os administradores podem ver o de todos e os gerentes de equipe podem ver os dos membros de sua equipe:

* Acumulado – quantos dias ou horas uma pessoa recebeu
* Utilizado – quantos dias ou horas uma pessoa gastou solicitando folga
* Disponível – quantos dias ou horas restantes que uma pessoa pode usar ao solicitar folga (acumulado menos usado)

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Screenshot-2025-09-15-at-18.05.51-1024x494.png)

Antes que as pessoas possam tirar uma folga, primeiro você precisa dar-lhes dias (ou horas), que podem usar ao solicitar uma folga:

lhes dias (ou horas), que podem usar ao solicitar uma folga:

* Ao gerenciar políticas de férias e folgas, observe que você pode habilitar a criação automática de entradas de folgas e feriados. Solicitações de folgas e feriados aprovados podem ser rastreados para o projeto escolhido, com a faturação extraída desse projeto ou tarefa.
* Você pode adicionar ou remover dias/horas acumulados clicando nos três pontos (e deixe um comentário por que a pessoa recebeu ou perdeu folga)
* Ao adicionar dias/horas, você precisa definir um **período de validade** (uma data de início e uma data de término) para qualquer saldo de tempo. Isso significa que o saldo expirará e será removido automaticamente após a data definida.
* Você pode adicionar ou remover dias/horas em massa ao visualizar o saldo agrupado por política e em seguida, verificar para quais usuários deseja adicionar/remover folgas

Quando o administrador adiciona ou remove folga manualmente, as colunas acumuladas são atualizadas.

Quando o saldo de uma pessoa é atualizado manualmente (por meio de adição ou remoção), ela e o gerente da equipe receberão um e-mail.

Histórico de saldo #
--------------------

Se você precisa saber por que uma determinada pessoa tem um número X de dias, pode clicar nos três pontos e clicar em Histórico.

* Os administradores podem ver o saldo de cada pessoa, bem como adicionar ou remover dias/horas acumulados.
* Os gerentes de equipe podem ver o saldo e o histórico de saldo de todos os seus membros, mas não podem editá-lo.

O histórico de saldo lista todas as solicitações de folga feitas por uma pessoa, seu status e alterações em sua acumulação: você pode ver o que foi alterado, quando e quem o fez:

* Solicitações pendentes e aprovadas removem tempo do saldo
* Solicitações rejeitadas e retiradas adiciona de volta o horário original ao saldo
* A ação manual do administrador pode adicionar ou remover o saldo acumulado (por exemplo, um membro recebe dias de folga quando um novo período começa ou faz horas extras e recebe folga)

# Add time manually - Clockify Help


## Chunk 1

If you forgot to start the timer, or you prefer to fill in all your work hours in one go, use manual mode.

Manual mode is also useful when you want to add past activities/events (e.g. previous week’s day to your timesheet).

Manual mode lets you add time entries one by one, specify start and end times, and date.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-20-at-11.35.54.png)

1. Enter manual mode by clicking the list icon in the upper right corner on the Time Tracker page
2. Optionally, type what you’ve worked on in the **What have you worked on?** box
3. Optionally, mark time as billable, select project/task, and add tags
4. Set the start and end time, or add time by duration
5. Change the date if needed, by clicking on the calendar icon and selecting the date
6. Add the entry by clicking **ADD**

If you’re adding a time entry for a different date, it will be added to the appropriate day header (whether the date is in the past or the future).

You can also use keyboard shortcuts when navigating through the Time Tracker page. Use **TAB** to move through fields and press **Enter** when you select **ADD** to add a new entry.

Add time by duration #
----------------------

Manual mode lets you add time entries by duration. Let’s say you’ve started working 2 hours ago, but you didn’t start the timer. To add past time:

1. Switch to manual mode
2. Cl


## Chunk 2

e entries by duration. Let’s say you’ve started working 2 hours ago, but you didn’t start the timer. To add past time:

1. Switch to manual mode
2. Click on the time (00:00:00)
3. Type 2h (or 200 or 2:00)
4. Click **ADD** to add the time entry

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/duration-manual.gif)

When you type 2h, the current time will be used as the start time and “the current time + 2h” as the end time.

You can input time in both clock and decimal notation. For example, to represent 2 hours and 45 minutes you worked, you can enter either “2.75” in decimal, or “2:45” in clock notation.

Duration format guide #
-----------------------

* If you type anything **between 1 and 59**, it will be interpreted as minutes (1 will become 1m)
* If you’re using decimal format, it will be interpreted as hours (1 will become 1h)
* If you type **60 or 99**, it will be interpreted as 1h or 1h39m
* If you type **123 or 1234**, it will be interpreted as 1h23m or 12h34m
* If you type **1:1** it will be interpreted as 1h1m (1:61 will become 2h01m)
* If you type **1:1:1**, it will be interpreted as 1h1m1s
* If you type 1h, 30m, 1s, 1h30m1s, it will be interpreted as 1 hour, 30 minutes, 1 second, or 1 hour 30 minutes and 1 second (or any other combo)
* If you type **0.1**, it will be interpreted as 6 minutes (0.2 will become 12m, 1.5 will become 1h30m, 7.2 will become 7h12m


## Chunk 3

ond (or any other combo)
* If you type **0.1**, it will be interpreted as 6 minutes (0.2 will become 12m, 1.5 will become 1h30m, 7.2 will become 7h12min)
* If you type **1.0** or **1,0**, it will be interpreted as 1 hour
* If you type **:30**, it will be interpreted as 30 minutes
* If you type **.5** or **.25**, it will be interpreted as 30 minutes or 15 minutes
* If you add multiple time entries, end time of the previous entry will be the start time of the next one

Input format for start and end time #
-------------------------------------

When you input the start and end time the duration will be displayed in the decimal format set in the settings: **Full** (hh:mm:ss), **Compact** (h:mm), **Decimal** (h.hh).

Clockify also accepts alternative inputs:

* You can omit the colons (e.g. **0345** will become 03:45/3:45AM)
* You can also use dots instead of colons (e.g. **9.45** will become 9:45)
* You can type **1am/1 am, 1pm/1 pm** and it will get converted to 01:00/1:00AM and 13:00/1:00PM, respectively
* If you type just one or two numbers, they will be treated as hours (e.g. **1** will become 01:00/01:00AM and **13** will become 13:00/1:00PM)
* If you type three numbers, the first number will become the hour and last two will become minutes (e.g. **130** will become 1:30/1:30AM)

You can control whether you want Clockify to show time in 12-hour or 24-hour format in your Profi


## Chunk 4

come minutes (e.g. **130** will become 1:30/1:30AM)

You can control whether you want Clockify to show time in 12-hour or 24-hour format in your Profile settings.

Please note that, if the start and end time include an overnight period, there will be a superscript number next to the end time, showing how many additional days the time entry covers.

Add time manually while your timer is running #
-----------------------------------------------

While it’s not possible to manually input time while you have a current timer running, you can use the duplicate option of a previous entry.

This will create a new time entry exactly as the previous one and you can change the details of that entry to whatever you need.

Force Timer #
-------------

With the Force timer feature available in the Pro plan, the manual mode on the Time Tracker can be disabled.

* Vous pouvez également saisir un point à la place des deux points (par exemple **9.45** deviendra 9:45)
* Vous pouvez taper **1am/1 am, 1pm/1 pm** et ils seront convertis en 01:00/1:00AM et 13:00/1:00PM, respectivement
* Si vous tapez seulement un ou deux chiffres, ils seront traités comme des heures (par exemple, **1** deviendra 01:00/01:00AM et **13** deviendra 13:00/1:00PM)
* Si vous tapez trois chiffres, le premier deviendra l'heure et les deux derniers les minutes (par exemple **130** deviendra 1:30/1:30AM)

Vous pouvez déterminer si Clockify doit afficher l'heure au format 12 heures ou 24 heures dans les Paramètres de votre profil.

Veuillez noter que, si l’heure de début et l’heure de fin comprennent une période de nuit, un nombre en exposant figure à côté de l’heure de fin, indiquant le nombre de jours supplémentaires couverts par la saisie de temps.

# Add time manually - Clockify Help


## Chunk 1

Si te olvidaste de iniciar el temporizador, o prefieres llenar todas tus horas de trabajo de un tirón, usa el modo manual.

El modo manual es útil cuando quieres añadir actividades/eventos pasados (por ejemplo, un día de la semana pasada) a tu planilla horaria.

El modo manual te permite añadir entradas de tiempo una por una, especificar las horas de inicio y de finalización y la fecha.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-20-at-11.35.54.png)

1. Activa el modo manual haciendo clic en el ícono de lista en la esquina superior derecha en la página de Rastreador
2. Opcionalmente, escribe en qué has trabajado en el cuadro **¿En qué has trabajado?**
3. Opcionalmente, marca el tiempo como facturable, selecciona un proyecto/tarea y añade etiquetas
4. Establece una hora de inicio y fin o añade el tiempo según la duración
5. Cambia la fecha si hace falta, haciendo clic en el ícono de calendario y seleccionando la fecha
6. Añade la entrada haciendo clic en **AÑADIR**

Si estás añadiendo una entrada de tiempo para una fecha diferente, se añadirá al encabezado del día correspondiente (no importa si la fecha está en el pasado o en el futuro).

or la página de Rastreador. Utiliza **TAB** para desplazarte por los campos y presiona **Enter** cuando selecciones **AÑADIR** para añadir una nueva entrada.

Añadir tiempo por duración #
----------------------------

El modo manual te permite añadir las entradas de tiempo según la duración. Digamos que has empezado a trabajar hace 2 horas, pero no iniciaste el temporizador. Para añadir el tiempo pasado:

1. Cambia al modo manual
2. Haz clic en el tiempo (00:00:00)
3. Escribe 2h (o 200 o 2:00)
4. Haz clic en **AÑADIR** para añadir la entrada de tiempo

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/duration-manual.gif)

Cuando escribes 2h, el tiempo actual se usará como la hora de inicio y “el tiempo actual + 2h” como la hora de finalización.

Puedes introducir el tiempo tanto en notación horaria como en decimal. Por ejemplo, para representar las 2 horas y 45 minutos que has trabajado, puedes introducir “2,75” en notación decimal o “2:45” en notación de reloj.

Guía de formatos de duración #
------------------------------

* Si escribes algo **entre 1 y 59**, se interpretará como minutos (1 se convertirá en 1 minuto)
* Si estás usando el formato decimal, se interpretarán como horas (1 se convertirá en 1 hora)
* Si escribes **60 o 99**, se interpretará como 1h o 1h39m
* Si escribes **123 o 1234**, se interpretará como 1h23m o 12h34m
* Si escribes **1:1** se interpretará

* Si escribes **123 o 1234**, se interpretará como 1h23m o 12h34m
* Si escribes **1:1** se interpretará como 1h 1min (1:61 se convertirá en 2h 01min)
* Si escribes **1:1:1**, se interpretará como 1h1m1s
* Si escribes 1h, 30min, 1s, 1h 30min 1s, se interpretará como 1 hora, 30 minutos, 1 segundo o 1 hora, 30 minutos y 1 segundo (o cualquier otra combinación)
* Si escribes **0,1**, se interpretará como 6 minutos (0,2 se convertirá en 12 min, 1,5 se convertirá en 1 h 30 min, 7,2 se convertirá en 7 h 12 min)
* Si escribes **1.0** o **1,0**, se interpretará como 1 hora
* Si escribes **:30**, se interpretará como 30 minutos
* Si escribes **.5** o **.25**, se interpretará como 30 minutos o 15 minutos
* Si añades varias entradas de tiempo, la hora de finalización de la entrada anterior será la hora de inicio de la siguiente

Formato de entrada de la hora de inicio y fin #
-----------------------------------------------

Cuando introduces la hora de inicio y finalización, la duración se mostrará en el formato decimal establecido en la configuración: **Completo** (hh:mm:ss), **Compacto** (h:mm), **Decimal** (h.hh).

Clockify también permite entradas alternativas:

* Puedes omitir los dos puntos (por ejemplo, **0345** será 03:45/3:45AM).
* Puedes escribir un punto en lugar de dos puntos (por ejemplo, **9.45** será 9:45)
* Puedes escribir 1am/


## Chunk 4

(por ejemplo, **0345** será 03:45/3:45AM).
* Puedes escribir un punto en lugar de dos puntos (por ejemplo, **9.45** será 9:45)
* Puedes escribir 1am/1 am, 1pm/1 pm y pasarán a 01:00/1:00AM y 13:00/1:00PM, respectivamente. **1am/1 am, 1pm/1 pm** y pasarán a 01:00/1:00AM y 13:00/1:00PM, respectivamente.
* Si escribes solo uno o dos números, se tratarán como horas (por ejemplo, **1** pasará a 01:00/01:00AM y **13** pasará a 13:00/1:00PM).
* Si escribes tres números, el primero número pasará a ser la hora y los últimos dos pasarán a minutos (por ejemplo, **130** será 1:30/1:30AM).

Puedes configurar si quieres que Clockify muestre el tiempo en formato de 12 o 24 horas en tu Configuración del perfil.

Ten en cuenta que, si la hora de inicio y finalización incluye un período nocturno, habrá un número en superíndice junto a la hora de finalización, que muestra cuántos días adicionales cubre la entrada de tiempo.

Wenn du vergessen hast, den Timer zu starten, oder wenn du alle Arbeitsstunden in einem Zug erledigen möchtest, kannst du den manuellen Modus verwenden.

Der manuelle Modus ist auch nützlich, wenn du vergangene Aktivitäten/Ereignisse (z. B. den Tag der Vorwoche) zu deiner Arbeitszeittabelle hinzufügen möchtest.

Im manuellen Modus kannst du nacheinander Zeiteinträge hinzufügen, Start- und Endzeiten sowie das Datum angeben.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-20-at-11.35.54.png)

1. Den manuellen Modus aktivieren, indem du auf der Time Tracker-Seite auf das Listensymbol in der oberen rechten Ecke klickst.
2. Optional eingeben, woran du gearbeitet hast, und zwar im Feld **Woran hast du gearbeitet?**
3. Optional kannst du die Zeit als abrechenbar markieren, ein Projekt/eine Aufgabe auswählen und Tags hinzufügen.
4. Die Start- und Endzeit festlegen, oder die Zeit nach Dauer hinzufügen
5. Bei Bedarf das Datum ändern, indem du auf das Kalendersymbol klickst und das Datum auswählst
6. Eintrag hinzufügen, indem du auf **HINZUFÜGEN** klickst

Wenn du einen Zeiteintrag für ein anderes Datum hinzufügst, wird dieser in die entsprechende Tagesüberschrift eingefügt (unabhängig davon, ob das Datum in der Vergangenheit oder in der Zukunft liegt).

Du kannst auch Tastenkombinationen verwenden, um durch die Seite "Zeiterfassungssystem" zu navigieren. Du so

Zeit nach Dauer hinzufügen #
----------------------------

Im manuellen Modus kannst du Zeiteinträge nach Dauer hinzufügen. Angenommen, du hast vor 2 Stunden mit der Arbeit begonnen, aber den Timer nicht gestartet. So fügst du vergangene Zeit hinzu:

1. Zum manuellen Modus wechseln
2. Auf die Uhrzeit klicken (00:00:00)
3. 2h eingeben (oder 200 oder 2:00)
4. Klicke auf **"HINZUFÜGEN"** , um den Zeiteintrag hinzuzufügen

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/duration-manual.gif)

Wenn du 2h eingibst, wird die aktuelle Zeit als Startzeit und "die aktuelle Zeit + 2h" als Endzeit verwendet.

Du kannst die Zeit sowohl in Uhr- als auch in Dezimalschreibweise eingeben. Wenn du beispielsweise 2 Stunden und 45 Minuten gearbeitet hast, kannst du entweder "2.75" in Dezimalschreibweise oder "2:45" in Uhrschreibweise eingeben.

# Adicionar tempo manualmente  Clockify


## Chunk 1

Se você esqueceu de iniciar o cronômetro ou prefere preencher todas as suas horas de trabalho de uma só vez, use o modo manual.

O modo manual é útil quando você deseja adicionar atividades/eventos anteriores (por exemplo, um dia da semana passada) à sua planilha de horas.

Também permite adicionar as entradas de tempo uma a uma, especificar as horas de início e de término e a data.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-20-at-11.35.54.png)

1. Para entrar no modo manual clique no ícone de lista no canto superior direito da página do Gerenciamento de tempo
2. Se quiser, digite no campo **No que você trabalhou?**
3. Também pode marcar o tempo como faturável, selecionar o projeto/tarefa e adicionar etiquetas
4. Defina a hora de início/fim ou adicione o tempo por duração
5. Se for necessário alterar a data, clique no ícone do calendário e selecione a data
6. Insira a entrada clicando em **ADICIONAR**

Se você estiver adicionando uma entrada de tempo para uma data diferente, ela será adicionada ao cabeçalho do dia apropriado (independentemente da data estar no passado ou no futuro).

Você também pode usar atalhos de teclado ao navegar pela página do Rastreador de tempo. Use **TAB** para percorrer os campos e pressione **Enter** ao selecionar **ADICIONAR** para adicionar uma nova entrada.

Adicionar tempo por duração #
---------------------------


## Chunk 2

s campos e pressione **Enter** ao selecionar **ADICIONAR** para adicionar uma nova entrada.

Adicionar tempo por duração #
-----------------------------

O modo manual permite adicionar entradas de tempo por duração. Digamos que você começou a trabalhar há 2 horas, mas não iniciou o cronômetro. Para adicionar o tempo passado:

1. Mude para o modo manual
2. Clique na hora (00:00:00)
3. Digite 2h (ou 200 ou 2:00)
4. Clique em **ADICIONAR** para inserir a entrada de tempo

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/duration-manual.gif)

Ao digitar 2h, a hora atual será usada como hora de início e “a hora atual + 2h” como hora de término.

Você pode inserir o tempo em notação de relógio e decimal. Por exemplo, para representar 2 horas e 45 minutos que você trabalhou, você pode inserir “2.75” em decimal ou “2:45” em notação de relógio.

Guia de formato de duração #
----------------------------

* Se você digitar algo **entre 1 e 59**, será interpretado como minutos (1 se tornará 1m)
* Se você estiver usando o formato decimal, ele será interpretado como horas (1 se tornará 1h)
* Se digitar **60 or 99**, será interpretado como 1h ou 1h39m
* Se digitar **123 ou 1234**, será interpretado como 1h23m ou 12h34m
* Se digitar **1:1** será interpretado como 1h1m (1:61 será 2h01m)
* Se digitar **1:1:1**, será interpretado como 1h1m1s
* Se você digitar 1h, 30m, 1s, 1h30m1s, será in


## Chunk 3

** será interpretado como 1h1m (1:61 será 2h01m)
* Se digitar **1:1:1**, será interpretado como 1h1m1s
* Se você digitar 1h, 30m, 1s, 1h30m1s, será interpretado como 1 hora, 30 minutos, 1 segundo ou 1 hora 30 minutos e 1 segundo (ou qualquer outra combinação)
* Se você digitar **0.1**, será interpretado como 6 minutos (0.2 se tornará 12m, 1.5 se tornará 1h30m, 7.2 se tornará 7h12min)
* Se você digitar **1.0** ou **1,0**, será interpretado como 1 hora
* Se digitar **:30**, será interpretado como 30 minutos
* Se você digitar **.5** ou **.25**, será interpretado como 30 minutos ou 15 minutos
* Se você adicionar várias entradas de tempo, a hora final da entrada anterior será a hora inicial da próxima

Inserir o formato para hora de início e término #
-------------------------------------------------

Ao inserir a hora de início e de término, a duração será exibida no formato decimal definido nas configurações: **Completo** (hh:mm:ss), **Compacto** (h:mm), **Decimal** (h.hh).

Clockify também aceita entradas alternativas:

* Você pode omitir os dois pontos (ex.: **0345** se tornará 03:45/3:45 AM)
* Você também pode digitar ponto em vez de dois pontos (ex.: **9.45** se tornará 9:45)
* Você pode digitar **01:00/01:00, 13:00/13:00** e será convertido para 01:00/01:00 e 13:00/13:00, respectivamente
* Se você digitar apenas um ou dois números, eles serão tratados como horas (ex.: **1** s


## Chunk 4

á convertido para 01:00/01:00 e 13:00/13:00, respectivamente
* Se você digitar apenas um ou dois números, eles serão tratados como horas (ex.: **1** se tornará 01:00/01:00 e **13** se tornará 13:00/13:00)
* Se você digitar três números, o primeiro número se tornará a hora e os dois últimos se tornarão minutos (ex.: **130** se tornará 1h30/1h30)

Você pode controlar se deseja que o Clockify mostre a hora no formato de 12 ou 24 horas em suas Configurações de perfil.

Observe que, se o horário de início e término incluir um período noturno, haverá um número sobrescrito ao lado do horário de término, mostrando quantos dias adicionais a entrada de tempo cobre.

Adicionar o tempo manualmente enquanto o cronômetro está funcionando #
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Embora não seja possível inserir a hora manualmente enquanto você tiver um cronômetro ativo, você pode usar a opção duplicar de uma entrada anterior.

Isso criará uma nova entrada de tempo exatamente como a anterior e você poderá alterar os detalhes dessa entrada para como precisar.

Forçar cronômetro #
-------------------

Com a ferramenta de Forçar cronômetro disponível no plano Pro, o modo manual no Rastreador de Tempo pode ser desativado.

# Admins & owners - Clockify Help


## Chunk 1

Admins & owners
===============

Clockify has two types of user roles in the **Administrative** category:

* **Owner**: User who created the workspace
* **Admin**: User with administrative permissions

Role overview #
---------------

**Admin** vs **Owner**:

If the Owner leaves the workspace, the entire workspace is deleted

Admins can appoint users as Managers, who have additional project and team management permissions.
Admins have a range of capabilities, including assigning roles, editing subscription payment information, managing groups, inviting users, setting user statuses, defining billable rates, overseeing time entries, scheduling projects and more.
However, admins have some limitations, especially when it comes to managing subscriptions and payment details.

Below is a detailed breakdown of admin permissions:

| Action | Permission |
| --- | --- |
| Track Time | Yes |
| See Time | Yes |
| Add/Edit Time | Yes |
| See and edit all expenses | Yes |
| See and edit all rates | Yes |
| See and edit all projects | Yes |
| See and edit all tasks | Yes |
| Manage users | Yes (except removing Admin role – Owner only) |
| Edit workspace settings | Yes |
| Delete workspace | Yes (Owner only – except on subdomain) |
| Transfer owner role | Yes (Owner only) |
| Set up SSO | Yes (Owner only) |
| Assign user roles | Yes |
| Manage groups | Yes |
| Invite users | Yes |
| Set up user


## Chunk 2

r role | Yes (Owner only) |
| Set up SSO | Yes (Owner only) |
| Assign user roles | Yes |
| Manage groups | Yes |
| Invite users | Yes |
| Set up user’s status (active/inactive) | Yes |
| Define billable rates | Yes |
| Edit ws settings | Yes |
| Create/edit/delete projects | Yes |
| Create/edit/delete tasks | Yes |
| Create/edit/delete team members | Yes |
| Create/edit/delete billable rates | Yes |
| Create/edit/delete project status | Yes |
| Schedule projects | Yes |
| Schedule assignments | Yes |
| Edit subscription payment information | Yes (Owner only) |
| Manage PTO | Yes |

Subscription and payment permissions #
--------------------------------------

While admins have many privileges in Clockify, **they do not have full access to subscription or payment-related information** if the workspace has an active subscription.

Specifically:

* **Admins** can access the **Subscription** page and the **Payment tab**, but they **cannot** edit **Customer information**, **Invoice information**, or **Subscription payment information**
* Admins **can** see **Customer and Invoice information**, but they **cannot** make any changes to them
* Admins have the ability to **add or remove full and limited seats** in the workspace, but **cannot remove bundle seats** or limited seats on a **Bundle plan**
* Admins can **cancel** or **reactivate** a subscription, and they can **download and p


## Chunk 3

ot remove bundle seats** or limited seats on a **Bundle plan**
* Admins can **cancel** or **reactivate** a subscription, and they can **download and pay invoices**
* Admins can access the **Plans tab** and make decisions to **upgrade** or **downgrade** the workspace plan, but they do not have access to the detailed payment information itself

Only the **Owner** can edit subscription payment details, manage customer information, and perform all other administrative tasks related to billing and payment.

For an overview of all user roles and permissions, check out Understanding user roles & access permissions.

# Admins & owners - Clockify Help


## Chunk 1

Clockify propose deux types de rôles d'utilisateur dans la catégorie **Administrative** :

* **Propriétaire**: Utilisateur qui a créé l'espace de travail
* **Administrateur**: Utilisateur ayant des droits d'administration

Aperçu des rôles #
------------------

**Administrateur** vs **Propriétaire**:

Si le propriétaire quitte l'espace de travail, l'ensemble de l'espace de travail est supprimé.

Les administrateurs peuvent nommer des utilisateurs en tant que responsables, qui disposent d'autorisations supplémentaires pour la gestion de projets et d'équipes.
Les administrateurs disposent d'un large éventail de possibilités, notamment l'attribution de rôles, la modification des informations relatives au paiement des abonnements, la gestion de groupes, l'invitation d'utilisateurs, la définition de statuts d'utilisateurs, la définition de taux facturables, la supervision des entrées de temps, la planification de projets et bien d'autres choses encore.
Cependant, les administrateurs ont certaines limites, notamment en ce qui concerne la gestion des abonnements et des détails de paiement.

# Admins & owners - Clockify Help


## Chunk 1

Clockify tiene dos tipos de roles de usuario en la categoría de **Administración**:

* **Propietario**: Usuario que creó el espacio de trabajo

Sin embargo, los administradores tienen algunas limitaciones, especialmente cuando se trata de gestionar suscripciones y detalles de pago.

A continuación se muestra un desglose detallado de los permisos de administrador:

* **Los administradores** pueden acceder a la página de **Suscripción** y a la pestaña de **Pago**, pero **no pueden** editar

# Agendar projetos Clockify


## Chunk 1

O agendamento de projetos simplifica o planejamento de projetos e a delegação de tarefas. Você pode visualizar cronogramas de projetos, ver custos projetados e valores faturáveis, atribuir tarefas a membros da equipe e usar a visualização Equipe para gerenciar sua disponibilidade. Mantenha-se organizado e melhore a colaboração da equipe.

O agendamento é uma ferramenta paga, que você pode ativar atualizando seu espaço de trabalho para o plano PRO ou ENTERPRISE.

O planejamento pode ser realizado pelos Administradores. Os gerentes de projeto só podem agendar seus próprios projetos.

A interface do usuário exibida neste vídeo pode não corresponder à versão mais recente do aplicativo.

Para agendar projetos e equipe, ative o **agendamento de projeto e equipe** nas Configurações do espaço de trabalho.

Problembehebung #
-----------------

Wenn du Probleme beim Anmelden hast, bitte beachte Folgendes:

Wenn du dich während der Anmeldung versehentlich mit einer neuen E-Mail-Adresse angemeldet hast, die mit keinem bestehenden Clockify-Konto zugeordnet ist, wirst du zum **Registrierungsbildschirm** weitergeleitet.

### Fehlerhafte Anmeldeversuche #

* Wenn du **fünfmal hintereinander** die falschen Anmeldedaten eingibst, wird dein Konto für **24 Stunden** gesperrt, um unbefugten Zugriff zu verhindern.
* Du erhältst eine E-Mail, die dich über die Sperrung benachrichtigt. Du kannst dein Konto manuell entsperren, bevor die 24 Stunden abgelaufen sind, um den Anmeldevorgang fortzusetzen.

Einloggen mit dem Einmaligen Anmelden (SSO) #
---------------------------------------------

Wenn du nicht jedes Mal deine Anmeldeinformationen eingeben möchtest, kannst du **Einmaliges Anmelden (SSO)** einrichten, das Clockify mit dem Identitätsanbieter deiner Organisation verbindet. So kannst du dich automatisch anmelden, ohne deine Anmeldeinformationen manuell eingeben zu müssen.

Diese Funktion ist im Enterprise-Plan verfügbar.

### SSO einrichten #

Ja, du kannst dich mit deinem Google-Konto anmelden:

* Klicke auf Mit Google fortfahren auf der Anmeldeseite
* Wähle die Google-E-Mail, die du mit deinem Clockify-Konto verknüpfen möchtest
* Du wirst zu deinem neu erstellten Arbeitsbereich automatisch weitergeleitet

#### Was, wenn ich eine falsche E-Mail oder ein falsches Passwort beim Anmelden eingebe? #

Wenn du dich fünfmal hintereinander mit den falschen Zugangsdaten anmeldest, wird dein Konto für **24 Stunden** gesperrt. Du erhältst eine E-Mail mit Anweisungen, wie du dein Konto manuell entsperren kannst, bevor die 24-stündige Sperre abläuft.

#### Was ist ein Bestätigungscode und wie lange ist er gültig? #

Ein Bestätigungscode ist ein 6-stelliger Code (Zahlen und Buchstaben), der dir zur Registrierung oder Anmeldung per E-Mail gesendet wird. Der Code ist für **30 Sekunden** gültig und muss umgehend eingegeben werden, um den Bestätigungsprozess abzuschließen.

#### Kann ich mich mit dem Einmaligen Anmelden (SSO) einloggen? #

Ja, wenn dein Arbeitsbereich mit einem Identitätsanbieter verbunden ist, kannst du dich mit dem **Einmaligen Anmelden (Single Sign-On, SSO)** anmelden. Dadurch musst du deine Anmeldedaten nicht jedes Mal eingeben, wenn du auf Clockify zugreifst. Admins können SSO in den **Arbeitsbereichseinstellungen** einrichten.

#### Was, wenn ich versuche, mich mit einer E-Mail-Adresse anzumelden, die mit meinem Konto nicht verknüpft ist? #

Wenn du versuchst, dich mit einer E-Mail-Adresse anzumelden, die über kein Clockify-Konto verfügt, wirst du zur **Registrierungsseite** weitergeleitet, um ein neues Konto mit dieser E-Mail zu erstellen.

* Du erhältst eine E-Mail, die dich über die Sperrung informiert
* Du kannst dein Konto manuell entsperren, indem du den Anweisungen in dieser E-Mail folgst. Die Sperrung läuft ansonsten automatisch nach 24 Stunden ab

**Autocomplete**

There’s an autocomplete option available when you tap on an entry and start typing a description.

## Chunk 7

This feature is available to all users on all subscription plans.

Widgets displays real-time data and provide easy access or shortcuts to certain actions for applications running on mobile devices.
To use a widget for your mobile app, you can usually just press and hold on an app icon and choose the **Widgets** option.

Three types of actions are available from Clockify widget:

* Start time entry with timer
* Track time again
* Track break

### Timer #

With this widget, you can start and stop the timer. After you tap **play**, the timer starts running along with the duration. When the timer is started, there’ll be an indication if billability or tag is on and available for this time entry.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/widget_new_logo-461x1024.jpg)

If you tap anywhere on the widget, the Time Tracker screen opens.

While Timer is running, the following time entry data is displayed:

* Description
* Project
* Task
* Client
* Tag
* Billable

If you stop the timer and all required fields are populated, this entry will be added to the Time Tracker. If all required fields are not populated, then the **Timer** screen opens and you will be prompted to fill out the required fields.

Custom fields are currently not available on widgets.

### Track again #

This widget displays 4 most recently tracked entries. You can choose one and start the timer.

### Track again #

This widget displays 4 most recently tracked entries. You can choose one and start the timer.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/tracking_via_widget_new_logo-461x1024.jpg)

When you tap play on any of the entries, timer starts again. If you tap on any place within the widget, Clockify app opens. If you tap again on a widget with a running entry again, the timer will stop.

There is a default widget size. However, the widget can be resized (reduce size, enlarge).

If timer doesn’t have all required fields, Time entry details opens for you to fill out.

### Track break #

If you’ve enabled the widget, you can see a tracking break icon alongside other icons on the widget when tracking time as a break. This way, you can easily see the difference between tracing work and break time without needing to open the app.

In this case, the time is tracked as a **break** entry type. The widget displays a cup that differentiates it from a regular time entry timer.

Y


## Chunk 20

oject in the app’s **Settings** > **Workspace** tab. Then when you start the timer or add a time entry, the project will be selected automatically.

You can select:

* **Fixed project**, which will be always used when you start a timer for an entry without a project (until you change the default project)
* **Last used project**, and the timer will pick up the most recently used available project from your list of time entries

If **Default project** is enabled, you won’t be able to have a time entry without a project assigned. Also, if you edit a previous entry that’s without a project, the app will automatically assign it to a default project.

### App theme #

Set an app theme that will follow the app system.

1. Go to **Settings** > **App** tab
2. Choose one of the following:
   * Light
   * Dark
   * System default

### Offline mode #

You can track time in Clockify on your Android even if you’re offline.

Create time entries manually or start/stop the timer. Entries made while offline will be saved locally on your phone. Once you get back online, they’ll get synced with your web account automatically.

When you’re offline, you will only be able to see information loaded while you were online (time entries, projects, tasks, tags, etc.). So projects, tasks, and tags are available for selection if they were loaded before you went offline.
Once you’re offline, you can see, ope

gs, etc.). So projects, tasks, and tags are available for selection if they were loaded before you went offline.
Once you’re offline, you can see, open and edit the expense, but the changes will be made once you go back online.

It’s not possible to create new projects, tasks, tags, and clients while offline.

If you notice that the app is very slow, it probably means you have an unstable internet connection. In that case, enable **Force offline mode**in Settings to improve performance. This will make the app behave as if it’s offline without you having to turn off your internet connection. After your turn off **Force offline mode**, the app will automatically sync all time entries.

If you are using the app in the **offline mode**, please make sure you’ve synced your time entries with the cloud prior to logging out. If you fail to do that, all the data that is not synced at the moment of logging out, will be lost.

If your access token expires while offline, you’ll be logged out when you reconnect. Unsynchronized data will automatically sync, and you’ll be notified if you were offline.

### Week start #

Customize your week start, align it with your routines or cultural practices and improve your efficiency.

Default week start is set up for all Workspace members in the Workspace settings on the Web app. Owners and Admins can change this configuration for individual users on t

The default day start is set to **09:00h**.

To change the default day start:

Go to the **Settings** screen and tap on the **Day start** option. Choose your preferred hour by inserting the numbers, or use a time picker option in the lower left corner. The time picker will differ based on the time format you’re set (12-hour or 24-hour).

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-16-at-14.10.31.png)

The change you’ve made in the Android app will be automatically applied to all other platforms you use with the same account.

Changing the starting hour of your working day in Clockify will impact these features: Timesheet and Time off.

### Time zone settings #

There are two ways in which you can set your time zone in the Android app:

* Choose time zone manually from the list of available time zones

The change you’ve made in the Android app will be automatically applied to all other platforms you use with the same account.
Also, if you set a time zone that is different from the time zone set on your Android device, in ord


## Chunk 23

ll other platforms you use with the same account.
Also, if you set a time zone that is different from the time zone set on your Android device, in order to track time you’ll need to change time zone in Clockify’s **Profile settings** > **Preferences** > **General** so that it matches your phone’s time zone.

* Set time zone automatically

If you’d like to set your time zone automatically, the app will automatically switch to the time zone set on your Android device. This time zone will be applied to all the platforms you use with the same account.

To ensure consistency and accuracy of the time tracking and the approvals, you won’t be able to change the time zone if you have pending approval request. Once the request is approved/rejected, you’ll be able to modify the time zone.

### Delete account #

You can delete your account from the Settings page:

1. Go to **Settings** > **App** tab
2. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and tap **Delete account**

## Chunk 8

-----------------------

Neben der Erfassung von Arbeitszeiten, Ausgaben und Pausen kannst du für die Mitglieder deines Arbeitsbereichs auch Urlaub und Feiertage erfassen.

Abwesenheits- und Feiertagseinträge können von Besitzern und Admins in der Web-App erstellen werden.

Sie werden im Timer, Arbeitszeittabellen, Kalender, Ausgaben, Arbeitsfreie Zeit und Berichten klar angezeigt.

Weitere Informationen dazu findest du im Artikel Abwesenheit und Feiertage erfassen.

Benutzer aller Abonnementpläne verfügen über die Funktion.

Widgets zeigen Daten in Echtzeit an und ermöglichen Tastenkombinationen oder einen einfachen Zugriff auf Apps, die auf mobilen Geräten ausgeführt werden.
Um ein Widget für deine mobile App zu verwenden, kannst du einfach ein App-Symbol gedrückt halten und die Option
**Widgets** auswählen.

Mit Clockify-Widget stehen dir zwei Aktionstypen zur Verfügung:

* Zeiteintrag mit Timer starten
* Zeit erneut erfassen
* Pause erfassen

### Timer #

Mit dem Widget kannst du den Timer starten und stoppen. Sobald du auf **Wiedergabe** tippst, beginnt der Timer sowie die Dauer zu laufen. Wenn der Timer startet, gibt es eine Anzeige, ob Berechenbarkeit oder Tag aktiviert und für den Zeiteintrag verfügbar sind.

## Chunk 9

lockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/widget_new_logo-461x1024.jpg)

Tippst du beliebig im Widget, wird der Bildschirm “Timer” geöffnet.

Während ein Timer läuft, werden folgende Zeiteintragsdaten angezeigt:

* Beschreibung
* Projekt
* Aufgabe
* Kunde
* Tag
* Abrechenbar

Sobald der Timer gestoppt wird und alle Pflichtfelder ausgefüllt sind, wird der Eintrag zum Timer hinzugefügt. Falls alle Pflichtfelder nicht ausgefüllt sind, wird der Bildschirm **Timer** geöffnet und du wirst aufgefordert, Pflichtfelder auszufüllen.

Benutzerdefinierte Felder sind derzeit für Widgets nicht verfügbar.

### Erneut erfassen #

Das Widget zeigt die 4 neuesten erfassten Einträge an. Du kannst einen auswählen und den Timer starten.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/tracking_via_widget_new_logo-461x1024.jpg)

Sobald du auf Wiedergabetaste für einen beliebigen Zeiteintrag klickst, startet der Timer wieder. Wenn du innerhalb des Widgets auf eine beliebige Stelle tippst, wird die Clockify-App geöffnet. Wenn du auf das Widget mit einem laufenden Eintrag wieder tippst, wird der Timer gestoppt.

Es gibt eine standardmäßige Größe von Widgets. Ein Widget kann trotzdem angepasst werden (Größe reduzieren oder vergrößern).

Falls ein Timer nicht alle Pflichtfelder hat, werden Zeiteintragsdetails geöffnet, damit du sie eingeben kannst.

### Pause erfassen #

## Chunk 10

Timer nicht alle Pflichtfelder hat, werden Zeiteintragsdetails geöffnet, damit du sie eingeben kannst.

### Pause erfassen #

Wenn du das Widget aktiviert hast, siehst du beim Erfassen von Pausenzeit ein spezielles Pausen-Symbol neben anderen Symbolen auf dem Widget. So kannst du den Unterschied zwischen erfasster Arbeits- und Pausenzeit leicht erkennen, ohne die App öffnen zu müssen.

In diesem Fall wird die Zeit als Eintragstyp **Pause** erfasst. Das Widget zeigt eine Tasse an, die diesen Eintrag von einem regulären Zeiteintrag-Timer unterscheidet.

Kalender #

### Standardprojekt #

Wenn du ständig am selben Projekt arbeitest, kannst du in der App unter **Einstellungen** > **Arbeitsbereich** ein Standardprojekt festlegen. Wenn du dann den Timer startest oder einen Zeiteintrag hinzufügst, wird das Projekt automatisch ausgewählt.

Du kannst wählen:

* **Festes Projekt**, das immer verwendet wird, wenn du einen Timer für einen Eintrag ohne Projekt startest (bis du das Standardprojekt änderst)
* Oder **das zuletzt verwendete Projekt**, und der Timer wird das zuletzt verwendete verfügbare Projekt aus der Liste der Zeiteinträge übernehmen

Wenn die Option **"Standardprojekt"**  aktiviert ist, kannst du keinen Zeiteintrag ohne ein zugewiesenes Projekt erstellen. Wenn du einen früheren Eintrag ohne Projekt bearbeiten möchtest, weist die App diesen automatisch einem Standardprojekt zu.

### App-Design #

Du kannst ein App-Design festlegen, das an das App-System angewendet wird.

1. Gehe zum Tab **Einstellungen** > **App**
2. Wähle eins der folgenden Designs aus:

* Systemstandard

### Offlinemodus #

Du kannst die Zeit in Clockify auf deinem Android-Gerät auch offline verfolgen.

Du kannst Zeiteinträge manuell erstellen oder den Timer starten/stoppen. Die Einträge, die offline erstellt werden, werden lokal auf deinem Handy gespeichert. Sobald du wieder online bist, werden sie automatisch mit deinem Webkonto synchronisiert.

Wenn du offline bist, kannst du nur die Informationen sehen, die geladen wurden, als du online warst (Zeiteinträge, Projekte, Aufgaben, Tags usw.). Projekte, Aufgaben und Tags stehen also zur Auswahl, wenn sie geladen wurden, bevor du offline gingst.
Wenn du offline bist, kannst du Ausgaben ansehen, öffnen und bearbeiten, aber die Änderungen werden erst vorgenommen werden, wenn du wieder online bist.

Es ist nicht möglich, neue Projekte, Aufgaben, Tags und Kunden zu erstellen, wenn du offline bist.

Wenn du feststellst, dass die App sehr langsam ist, bedeutet dies wahrscheinlich, dass du eine instabile Internetverbindung hast. In diesem Fall solltest du in den Einstellungen die Option **Offlinemodus erzwingen**aktivieren, um die Leistung zu verbessern. Dadurch verhält sich die App so, als ob sie offline wäre, ohne dass du deine Internetverbindung ausschalten musst. Nach der Deaktivierung von **Offlinemodus erzwingen**, synchronisiert die App automatisch alle Zeiteinträge.

## Chunk 26

ch der Deaktivierung von **Offlinemodus erzwingen**, synchronisiert die App automatisch alle Zeiteinträge.

Bei der Verwendung der App im **Offlinemodus**, solltest du sicherstellen, dass du deine Zeiteinträge mit der Cloud synchronisiert hast, bevor du dich abmeldest. Wenn du das nicht tust, gehen alle Daten, die zum Zeitpunkt der Abmeldung nicht synchronisiert sind, verloren.

Falls dein Zugriffstoken abgelaufen ist, während du offline bist, wirst du bei erneuter Verbindung abgemeldet. Unsynchronisierte Daten werden automatisch synchronisiert und du wirst benachrichtigt, falls du offline warst.

### Wochenstart #

Du kannst deinen Wochenbeginn an deine Routinen und kulturellen Gepflogenheiten anpassen und deine Effizienz verbessern.

Der standardmäßige Wochenstart ist für alle Mitglieder eines Arbeitsbereichs in den Arbeitsbereichseinstellungen in der Web-App festgelegt. Besitzer und Admins können diese Konfiguration für individuelle Benutzer in der Clockify-Web-App, Team-Seite > Profileinstellungen ändern.

### Tagesstart #

Du kannst nicht nur den Wochenanfang anpassen, sondern auch die Arbeitszeiten und den Tagesanfang festlegen.

Der standardmäßige Tagesanfang ist auf **09:00h** Uhr festgelegt.

Um den standardmäßigen Tagesanfang zu ändern, solltest du:

Zum Bildschirm **Einstellungen** gehen und auf die Option **Tagesanfang** tippen. Dann solltest du deine bevorzugte Stunde auswählen, indem du die Zahlen einfügst, oder die Option "Zeitauswahl" in der unteren linken Ecke verwendest. Die Zeitauswahl unterscheidet sich je nach dem eingestellten Zeitformat (12- oder 24-Stunden).

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-16-at-14.10.31.png)

Die Änderung, die du in der Android-App vorgenommen hast, wird automatisch auf alle anderen Plattformen angewendet, die du mit demselben Konto nutzt.

Wenn du die Anfangszeit deines Arbeitstages in Clockify änderst, hat dies Auswirkungen auf diese Funktionen: Arbeitszeittabelle und Arbeitsfreie Zeit.

### Zeitzoneneinstellungen #

Es gibt zwei Möglichkeiten, wie du deine Zeitzone in der Android-App festlegen kannst:

* Zeitzone manuell aus der Liste der verfügbaren Zeitzonen auswählen

Die Änderung, die du in der Android-App vorgenommen hast, wird automatisch auf alle anderen Plattformen angewendet, die du mit demselben Konto nutzt.
Wenn du eine Zeitzone festgelegt hast, die sich von der Zeitzone auf deinem Android-Gerät unterscheidet, musst du die Zeitzone in Clockify, **Profileinstellungen** > **Einstellungen** > **Allgemein**, so ändern, dass sie mit der Zeitzone deines Handys übereinstimmt, um die Zeit zu erfassen.

* Zeitzone


## Chunk 28

ellungen** > **Einstellungen** > **Allgemein**, so ändern, dass sie mit der Zeitzone deines Handys übereinstimmt, um die Zeit zu erfassen.

* Zeitzone automatisch festlegen

Wenn du deine Zeitzone automatisch festlegen möchtest, wechselt die App automatisch in die Zeitzone um, die auf deinem Android-Gerät festgelegt ist. Diese Zeitzone wird auf alle Plattformen angewendet, die du mit demselben Konto nutzt.

Um die Konsistenz und Genauigkeit der Zeiterfassung und der Genehmigungen sicherzustellen, kannst du die Zeitzone nicht ändern, wenn du eine ausstehende Genehmigungsanforderung hast. Sobald der Antrag genehmigt/abgelehnt ist, kannst du die Zeitzone ändern.

### Konto löschen #

Du kannst dein Konto auf der Seite “Einstellungen” löschen:

1. Gehe zum Tab **Einstellungen** > **App**
2. Scrolle nach unten und tippe auf **Konto löschen**

# Angesammelte Überstunden - Clockify-Hilfe


## Chunk 1

Die arbeitsfreie Zeit ist eine kostenpflichtige Funktion, die du aktivieren kannst, indem du deinen Arbeitsbereich auf den Standard-, Pro- oder Enterprise-Abonnementplan aktualisierst.

Im Tab **Saldo** werden die angesammelten Tage angezeigt. Du kannst sehen, wie viel arbeitsfreie Zeit jedes Mitglied für jede Richtlinie hat, wie viel es schon genommen hat sowie ein detailliertes Protokoll der Änderungen im Saldoverlauf.

Angesammelte Überstunden verwalten #
------------------------------------

Du kannst einen Saldo nach Richtlinie (z. B. Urlaubssaldo für jedes Teammitglied) oder nach Benutzer (z. B. Saldo für jede Richtlinie für einen bestimmten Benutzer) ansehen.

Reguläre Benutzer können den Saldoverlauf nur für ihre eigene Richtlinie, Admins für alle Angestellte und Teammanager für jede Richtlinie für einen bestimmten Benutzer ansehen:

* Aufgelaufen - wie viele Tage oder Stunden erhalten werden
* Gebraucht - wie viele Tage oder Stunden schon genommen wurden
* Verfügbar - wie viele Tage oder Stunden noch verfügbar sind und für Urlaubsanträge verwendet werden können (aufgelaufenes Minus gebraucht).

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Screenshot-2025-09-15-at-18.05.51-1024x494.png)

Bevor Mitarbeiter eine Abwesenheit beantragen können, solltest du zuerst ihnen Tage (oder Stunden) zuweisen, die sie bei der Anforderung von arbeitsfreier Zeit nehmen können:


## Chunk 2

bwesenheit beantragen können, solltest du zuerst ihnen Tage (oder Stunden) zuweisen, die sie bei der Anforderung von arbeitsfreier Zeit nehmen können:

* Wenn eine Person noch keinen Zeitausgleich angesammelt hat, kannst du den Anfangssaldo festlegen, indem du auf **Hinzufügen** neben ihrem Namen klickst.
* Du kannst angesammelte Tage/Stunden hinzufügen, indem du auf die drei Punkte klickst (und einen Kommentar darüber hinterlässt, warum eine Person die Abwesenheit erhalten oder nicht erhalten hat)
* Wenn du Tage/Stunden hinzufügst, musst du für jeden Freistellungssaldo einen **Gültigkeitszeitraum** (ein Start- und ein Enddatum) festlegen. Das bedeutet, dass der Saldo nach dem festgelegten Datum abläuft und automatisch entfernt wird.
* Du kannst Tage/Stunden massenhaft hinzufügen oder entfernen, wenn du den Saldo überprüfst, die nach Richtlinie gruppiert wird, und dann markieren, für welche Benutzer du arbeitsfreie Zeit hinzufügen/entfernen möchtest.

Wenn ein Admin arbeitsfreie Zeit manuell hinzufügt oder entfernt, werden die Spalten “Aufgelaufen” aktualisiert.

Wenn der Saldo einer Person manuell aktualisiert wird (über Hinzufügen oder Entfernen), erhält sie und ihr Teammanager eine E-Mail.

## Chunk 3

u wissen solltest, warum eine bestimmte Person X Anzahl der Tage hat, kannst du auf die drei Punkte und dann auf “Verlauf” klicken.

* Reguläre Benutzer können nur ihren eigenen Saldo sowie den Verlauf ansehen.
* Admins können den Saldo für jede Person ansehen, sowie angesammelte Tage/Stunden hinzufügen oder entfernen.
* Teammanager können für alle ihre Mitglieder den Saldo und Verlauf ansehen, aber sie können sie nicht bearbeiten.

Der Saldoverlauf führt alle Abwesenheitsanträge auf, die erstellt werden, ihren Status und Änderungen an der aufgelaufenen Zeit: du kannst sehen, was geändert wird, wann und wer die Änderung vorgenommen hat:

* Bestehende und genehmigte Anträge entfernen Zeit vom Saldo
* Abgelehnte und zurückgezogene Anträge fügen die ursprüngliche Zeit zum Saldo wieder hinzu
* Admin können angesammelte Zeit zum Saldo manuell hinzufügen oder sie vom Saldo auf gleiche Weise entfernen (z. B. Mitglieder erhalten arbeitsfreie Tage, wenn eine neue Zeitperiode anfängt oder wenn sie Überstunden machen und Freizeitausgleich bekommen).

# Anmeldung ohne Passwort in Clockify - Clockify-Hilfe


## Chunk 1

Passwortfreie Anmeldung in Clockify
===================================

**Die passwortfreie Anmeldung** ist eine Authentifizierungsmethode, für die keine Passwörter nötig sind. Statt ein Passwort einzugeben, musst du dich mit dem **OTP (One-time password)**  Code authentifizieren, der an deine E-Mail-Adresse gesendet wird.

So funktioniert die passwortfreie Anmeldung in Clockify #
---------------------------------------------------------

1. Deine E-Mail-Adresse auf der Clockify-Anmeldungsseite eingeben
2. OTP-Code wird an deine E-Mail-Adresse gesendet
3. OTP-Code in die dafür vorgesehenen Felder auf der Anmeldeseite eingeben
4. Nach der Authentifizierung wirst du bei deinem Clockify-Konto automatisch angemeldet

Wenn du Bestätigungs-E-Mails nicht erhältst, liegt dies möglicherweise an zu vielen ungenutzten OTP-Codes. Um dies zu beheben, solltest du die letzte Bestätigungs-E-Mail einfach öffnen und die Schaltfläche **Hier klicken** anklicken, um E-Mails wieder zu erhalten. Benutze deinen Anmeldecode immer innerhalb von 30 Minuten, um dieses Problem in Zukunft zu vermeiden.

## Chunk 2

Clockify

Vorteile der passwortfreien Anmeldung #
---------------------------------------

**Die passwortfreie Anmeldung** bietet verbesserte Sicherheit im Vergleich zur traditionellen passwortbasierten Authentifizierung sowie weitere Vorteile:

* **Benutzerfreundlichkeit**
  Es ist nicht nötig, ein Passwort zu merken oder es einzugeben. Eine einfache Aktion (OTP-Code eingeben) ermöglicht dir den Zugriff
* **Verbesserte Sicherheit**
  Ohne ein Passwort kannst du die üblichen Sicherheitsrisiken im Zusammenhang mit Passwörtern beseitigen:
  + Passwort wiederverwenden (dasselbe Passwort über mehrere Sites verwenden)
  + Phishing-Angriff (Benutzer dazu bringen, ihr Passwort auf einer gefälschten Website einzugeben)
  + Schwache oder gestohlene Passwörter
* **Niedriges Risiko vor Kontogefährdung**
  Da es keine Passwörter gibt, besteht keine Gefahr, dass Passwörter durch Brute-Force-Angriffe durchgesickert, erraten oder gestohlen werden.

Viele große Unternehmen verwenden die passwortfreie Anmeldung, da diese sicher ist und ermöglicht eine bessere Benutzererfahrung. Sie schützt dein Konto vor den üblichen Gefahren und macht die Anmeldung gleichzeitig einfacher und schneller.

Der Anwesenheitsbericht ermöglicht Benutzern, tägliche Anwesenheit sowie Abwesenheit, Überstunden und mehr in ihrem Team zu verfolgen.
Mit dem Anwesenheitsbericht hast du den Überblick darüber, wann deine Teammitglieder mit der Arbeit angefangen haben und fertig waren, wie viel sie jeden Tag gearbeitet haben, wer sich frei genommen oder keine Stunden erfasst hat und wer Überstunden oder Minusstunden gemacht hat. Außerdem kannst du die Aufschlüsselung von Kosten und abrechenbaren Beträgen für geplante und erfasste Zeit überprüfen.

Der Anwesenheitsbericht ist eine kostenpflichtige Funktion, die du aktivieren kannst, indem du deinen Arbeitsbereich auf den Standard-, Pro- oder Enterprise-Abonnementplan aktualisierst und ist für Benutzer mit der Admin- oder Teammanagerrolle verfügbar.
Admins können alle Benutzer sehen, während Teammanager nur die Benutzer sehen können, die sie verwalten.

# Aperçu des intégrations - Aide Clockify


## Chunk 1

Lancez le minuteur Clockify à partir d'autres outils web, comme JIRA, Trello, Asana, Todoist, et d'autres (voir la page des intégrations pour la liste complète).

L’interface utilisateur présentée dans cette vidéo peut ne pas correspondre à la dernière version de l’appli.

Il suffit d'installer l'extension Chrome ou Firefox, pour qu’un bouton de minuteur apparaisse dans les tâches, les problèmes, les leads, les événements etc. de votre appli Web préférée.

L' extension de navigateur est open source, alors n'hésitez pas à créer de nouvelles intégrations ou à améliorer celles qui existent déjà.

Pour utiliser l'intégration JIRA, vous devez installer le plugin Clockify pour JIRA. Consultez cette page du Centre d'aide pour obtenir des instructions détaillées.

Synchronisation des projets et des tâches #
-------------------------------------------

L'extension peut également reprendre le nom d'un projet depuis une autre appli s'il existe un projet dans Clockify avec le même nom (p. ex. vous avez un **Projet X** dans Clockify et Asana/JIRA/Trello/Todoist).

L'extension Clockify peut également créer et sélectionner des projets, des tâches et des balises en fonction de l'intégration :

* S'il y a un projet ou une tâche avec le même nom dans Clockify, il sera sélectionné.
* S'il n'y a pas de projet ou de tâche et que vous avez l’autorisation de le créer (en fonction des paramètres de l'


## Chunk 2

ns Clockify, il sera sélectionné.
* S'il n'y a pas de projet ou de tâche et que vous avez l’autorisation de le créer (en fonction des paramètres de l'espace de travail), un nouveau projet ou une nouvelle tâche sera automatiquement créé et sélectionné.

Pour activer la création de projets/tâches/balises, vous devez d'abord l'activer dans les paramètres de l'extension.

Chaque intégration est différente. Par exemple, une tâche et un projet peuvent être créés à partir d'Asana, Gitlab récupérera également les balises, mais Gmail ne fera rien d'autre que récupérer la description.

Si vous avez besoin d'une assistance pour d'autres intégrations, n'hésitez pas à contribuer au code de l'extension sur Github.

Domaines personnalisés #
------------------------

Si vous utilisez un outil auto-hébergé que vous utilisez sur une URL personnalisée (p. ex. vous utilisez YouTrack sur mydomain.com), vous devrez ajouter votre domaine et le connecter à l'outil correspondant :

1. Ouvrez l'extension
2. Ouvrez les paramètres (menu hamburger dans le coin supérieur gauche)
3. Cliquez sur **Intégrations**
4. Faites défiler la page vers le bas et sous **Domaines personnalisés** entrez votre domaine (p. ex. mydomain.com)
5. Sélectionnez l'outil qui se trouve sur ce domaine
6. Cliquez sur **Ajouter**

Désactivez les intégrations #
-----------------------------

Si vous ne voulez pas que le bouton apparais


## Chunk 3

e sur ce domaine
6. Cliquez sur **Ajouter**

Désactivez les intégrations #
-----------------------------

Si vous ne voulez pas que le bouton apparaisse dans certaines applis web, vous pouvez le désactiver dans les **Intégrations**.

* Ouvrez l'extension
* Cliquez sur l'icône de menu dans le coin supérieur droit
* Cliquez sur le bouton **Intégrations** et vous accéderez à la page de la liste des intégrations
* Décochez les applications pour lesquelles vous ne souhaitez pas voir le bouton **Démarrer le minuteur**

Si vous utilisez une version auto-hébergée / sur site d'une appli (comme JIRA ou Gitlab), en bas de la page **Intégrations** , vous pouvez spécifier le domaine dans lequel l'appli est installée.

# [ARTICLE] Aperçu des taux horaires - Aide Clockify
https://clockify.me/help/fr/reports/hourly-rates/

# Aperçu des taux horaires - Aide Clockify


## Chunk 1

Clockify peut appliquer différents taux horaires à vos entrées de temps facturable et montrer combien d'argent vous gagnez dans des rapports.

Clockify multiplie chaque entrée de temps facturable avec le taux horaire correspondant et ce nombre est affiché comme gain dans un rapport.

Pour que Clockify puisse calculer les taux horaires, vous devez d'abord marquer les entrées de temps comme facturables dans le suivi du temps (ou dans le rapport détaillé) en cliquant sur le signe $.

Si vous n'utilisez pas de taux horaires, vous pouvez supprimer complètement toutes les informations de facturation de l'interface pour tout le monde en désactivant l'option **Activer les heures facturables** dans les paramètres de l'espace de travail > onglet “Autorisations”, ou vous pouvez la masquer uniquement pour les utilisateurs réguliers.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-26-at-10.46.54-1024x679.png)

Types de taux horaires #
------------------------

Il existe plusieurs types de taux horaires dans Clockify :

* **Le taux de l'espace de travail**, que vous définissez dans les paramètres de l'espace de travail ; il est appliqué à tous les taux de temps facturables, à moins qu'il ne soit remplacé par un taux facturable plus spécifique.
* **Le taux de membre**, que vous définissez sur la page Équipe pour chaque utilisateur
* **Le taux de projet**, que vous

facturable plus spécifique.
* **Le taux de membre**, que vous définissez sur la page Équipe pour chaque utilisateur
* **Le taux de projet**, que vous définissez pour chaque projet
* **Le taux de travail**, si activé dans les paramètres de l'espace de travail
* **Le taux membre des projets**, que vous définissez dans l'onglet Accès des projets

En plus des taux facturables, vous pouvez également disposer d'un autre ensemble de taux pour les coûts de main-d'œuvre.

Taux facturable appliqué #
--------------------------

**Un taux facturable plus spécifique prévaut sur un taux moins spécifique :**
**Le taux du membre du projet** > **Taux par tâche** > **Taux de projet** > **Taux de membre** > ****Taux de l’espace de travail****.

Par exemple, disons que vous êtes un freelance et que vous avez un taux


## Chunk 3

*Taux de projet** > **Taux de membre** > ****Taux de l’espace de travail****.

Par exemple, disons que vous êtes un freelance et que vous avez un taux par défaut que vous facturez sur tous les projets. Vous définissez ce taux comme le taux facturable de votre espace de travail. Ensuite, vous avez également un client à qui vous facturez un taux différent. Dans ce cas, vous pouvez créer un projet, l'affecter au client et définir le taux horaire souhaité pour ce projet.

**Pour définir des prix différents par client au niveau du projet :**

1. Créez différents projets
2. Attribuez-les aux clients respectifs
3. Allez dans “Projets” et cliquez sur le nom du projet
4. Cliquez sur l'onglet **Paramètres**
5. Définissez le taux facturable souhaité pour chaque projet dans la section **Taux de facturation du projet**

Vous ne pouvez pas attribuer un taux facturable personnalisé pour une entrée de temps spécifique. Mais vous pouvez utiliser une balise pour indiquer un taux facturable spécial afin de savoir combien facturer lors de la préparation d'une facture.

Définir une devise personnalisée #
----------------------------------

La devise ne peut être modifiée que par l'administrateur de l'espace de travail et elle est appliquée à l'ensemble du compte (y compris les taux facturables).

Qui peut voir les taux horaires #
---------------------------------

Seul l'administrateur de l'espace de travail peut fixer des taux horaires pour l'espace de travail, l'utilisateur et le projet.
Les chefs de projet peuvent fixer des taux horaires pour les personnes travaillant sur leurs projets si l'option **Qui peut voir les taux facturables** dans les paramètres de l'espace de travail est réglée sur Tout le monde.
Les membres réguliers ne peuvent pas fixer ou modifier des taux horaires.

Pour plus d'informations, consultez l'article Comprendre les rôles des utilisateurs et les autorisations d'accès.

Partager des données supplémentaires avec les employés #
--------------------------------------------------------

Si vous souhaitez que vos employés voient leurs revenus et leurs taux horaires, mais ne souhaitez pas qu'ils voient les taux d'autres personnes ou vous souhaitez les limiter aux taux de coûts, vous pouvez créer un rapport partagé :

1. Ou

4. Cliquez sur l'icône de partage
5. Nommez le rapport et définissez-le comme privé
6. Choisissez qui peut voir le rapport
7. Votre employé peut maintenant accéder au rapport que vous avez créé

Facturation des projets et des tâches #
---------------------------------------

Vous pouvez modifier si les entrées de temps sur un projet sont facturables ou non facturables par défaut.

Vous pouvez définir le statut de facturabilité par défaut du projet lorsque vous cliquez sur un projet à partir de la page “Projets” et que vous accédez à l'onglet **Paramètres du projet**.

Si vous définissez le projet comme facturable, lorsque quelqu'un suit le temps et ne spécifie pas la facturabilité, l'entrée de temps sera marquée comme facturable (que vous pouvez modifier plus tard).

Il est possible de modifier le statut de facturabilité de la même manière que vous l'avez défini, dans l'onglet “Paramètres du projet”. Une fois que le statut de facturation du projet est modifié, par exemple de facturable à non facturable, cela n'affectera pas les entrées de temps précédemment créées. Leur statut restera le même qu'au

modifié, par exemple de facturable à non facturable, cela n'affectera pas les entrées de temps précédemment créées. Leur statut restera le même qu'au moment de leur création. Cependant, toutes les nouvelles saisies de temps liées à ce projet seront automatiquement placées dans le nouveau statut, dans ce cas, non facturable.

Si vous avez des tâches facturables et d'autres non facturables sur un projet, vous pouvez choisir leur statut facturable en activant les taux de tâches dans les paramètres de l'espace de travail.

Qui peut voir et modifier le statut facturable des entrées #
------------------------------------------------------------

Vous pouvez choisir si vous voulez que seuls les administrateurs puissent voir le statut de facturation des entrées. De cette façon, les utilisateurs ordinaires ne pourront pas voir le symbole de la devise et, par conséquent, modifier le statut de facturation des entrées.

This option is in the Workspace Settings->Permission, and it is available if you upgrade to any paid plan. You can try out the feature for free by activating the free 7-day trial (no credit card required).

Taux historiques #
------------------

Lorsque vous modifiez un taux horaire, ce nouveau taux sera appliqué uniquement aux nouvelles entrées de temps que vous créerez à partir de ce moment.

Par exemple, si le taux d'un membre de l'équipe est de 20 $ et que vous le modif


## Chunk 7

x nouvelles entrées de temps que vous créerez à partir de ce moment.

Par exemple, si le taux d'un membre de l'équipe est de 20 $ et que vous le modifiez à 40 $, toutes ses entrées de temps existantes auront toujours le taux original de 20 $. Mais s'il crée une nouvelle entrée de temps (quelle que soit la date), cette nouvelle entrée aura le nouveau taux de 40 $.

Vous pouvez voir le taux horaire de chaque entrée lorsque vous survolez le montant dans le rapport détaillé (ainsi que dans l'exportation CSV/Excel).

### Appliquer de nouveaux taux aux entrées de temps existantes #

Les entrées de temps reprennent le dernier taux chaque fois que vous mettez à jour le projet, l'utilisateur ou le statut facturable d'une entrée de temps.

Pour remplacer le taux horaire précédent :

* Faites en sorte que le nouveau taux s'applique rétroactivement aux entrées existantes à partir de l'écran où vous modifiez le taux (toute fonction de plan payant)
* **Mettre à jour manuellement les entrées de temps****:**
  1. Accédez au suivi des temps ou au rapport détaillé
  2. Cliquez sur l'icône facturable pour marquer l'entrée comme non facturable
  3. Cliquez à nouveau pour la marquer comme facturable (cela réinitialisera son taux à la dernière version)

# Aperçu des taux horaires - Aide Clockify


## Chunk 1

Clockify peut appliquer différents taux horaires à vos entrées de temps facturable et montrer combien d'argent vous gagnez dans des rapports.

Clockify multiplie chaque entrée de temps facturable avec le taux horaire correspondant et ce nombre est affiché comme gain dans un rapport.

Pour que Clockify puisse calculer les taux horaires, vous devez d'abord marquer les entrées de temps comme facturables dans le suivi du temps (ou dans le rapport détaillé) en cliquant sur le signe $.

Si vous n'utilisez pas de taux horaires, vous pouvez supprimer complètement toutes les informations de facturation de l'interface pour tout le monde en désactivant l'option **Activer les heures facturables** dans les paramètres de l'espace de travail > onglet “Autorisations”, ou vous pouvez la masquer uniquement pour les utilisateurs réguliers.

Types de taux horaires #
------------------------

Il existe plusieurs types de taux horaires dans Clockify :

* **Le taux de l'espace de travail**, que vous définissez dans les paramètres de l'espace de travail ; il est appliqué à tous les taux de temps facturables, à moins qu'il ne soit remplacé par un taux facturable plus spécifique.
* **Le taux de membre**, que vous définissez sur la page Équipe pour chaque utilisateur
* **Le taux de projet**, que vous


## Chunk 2

facturable plus spécifique.
* **Le taux de membre**, que vous définissez sur la page Équipe pour chaque utilisateur
* **Le taux de projet**, que vous définissez pour chaque projet
* **Le taux de travail**, si activé dans les paramètres de l'espace de travail
* **Le taux membre des projets**, que vous définissez dans l'onglet Accès des projets

En plus des taux facturables, vous pouvez également disposer d'un autre ensemble de taux pour les coûts de main-d'œuvre.

Benutzer aller Abonnementpläne verfügen über die Funktion.

Clockify ermöglicht es dir, erweiterte Einstellungen für dein Profil zu verwalten und zu konfigurieren, wie zum Beispiel **Webhooks** und **API-Schlüssel**. So erhältst du mehr Kontrolle über die Sicherheit und Effizienz deines Kontos.

API-Schlüssel #
---------------

Es ist wichtig, deinen API-Schlüssel an einem sicheren Ort zu speichern. Wenn du einen Schlüssel verlierst oder ihn nicht speicherst, wird die Generierung eines neuen Schlüssels den alten Schlüssel deaktivieren, wodurch möglicherweise bestehende Einstellungen und Integrationen unterbrochen werden.
In Clockify kannst du deine API-Schlüssel speichern und diese nach Bedarf bearbeiten.

Du findest API-Schlüssel-Einstellungen in der Registerkarte **Erweitert** in deinen **Profileinstellungen**

### Continuar con Google #

1. Elige el correo electrónico de Google
2. O crea uno que usaste para crear tu cuenta Clockify

Serás redirigido a la pantalla de Rastreador de tiempo de inmediato y podrás comenzar a rastrear el tiempo.

### Inicio de sesión con dominio personalizado y subdominio #

Si utilizas un **dominio personalizado** o un **subdominio**, también puedes utilizar la aplicación de Android.

1. Abre la aplicación e introduce el correo electrónico de tu cuenta de Clockify
2. Elige el espacio de trabajo asociado con tu subdominio/dominio personalizado
3. Serás redirigido al subdominio en cuestión y se te solicitará que inicies sesión nuevamente para acceder a tu espacio de trabajo

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot_20250218_114006_Clockify-461x1024.png)

Después de la verificación exitosa, serás redirigido a la pantalla de **Rastreador** y podrás comenzar a rastrear el tiempo nuevamente.

### Control de tiempo #

Se puede hacer un seguimiento de tiempo en la aplicación Android de Clockify de dos maneras diferentes, usando un temporizador o añadiendo el tiempo manualmente.

Clockify agrupa las entradas de tiempo similares bajo una entrada expandible.

Si quieres ver las entradas en orden cronológico, ve a **Configuraci


## Chunk 3

.

Clockify agrupa las entradas de tiempo similares bajo una entrada expandible.

Si quieres ver las entradas en orden cronológico, ve a **Configuración del perfil** > **Preferencias** en la aplicación web y desactiva **Agrupar entradas de tiempo similares**.

Existe una opción de autorrelleno disponible cuando tocas una entrada y comienzas a escribir una descripción.

### Modo de temporizador #

Para iniciar un temporizador:

1. Toca el botón **+** en la esquina inferior derecha y aparecerá una pantalla de entrada de tiempo
2. Toca el botón de **Reproducción** en la esquina inferior derecha para empezar a trabajar
3. Completa los detalles (descripción, proyecto, tarea, facturabilidad, etiquetas)
4. Toca el botón de **Detener** para detener el temporizador y guardar la entrada de tiempo, o la opción **Descartar** en la esquina superior derecha para descartarla

Puedes introducir el tiempo si pulsas los números en el desplazador, en lugar de desplazarte por los números para llegar a la hora deseada.

#### Añadir/quitar atajos de duración #

Para optimizar el proceso de modificación de entradas, al agregar tiempo manualmente, puedes agregar fácilmente la duración usando los botones de acceso directo ubicados debajo del campo de duración.

Se pueden agregar los siguientes lapsos de tiempo:

El valor que se muestra en los botones de acceso directo se basa en la duración de la entrada (por ejemplo, si la duración es inferior a una hora, el botón -1 está deshabilitado).
Haz clic en uno de los botones y ese valor se sumará/restará del tiempo registrado.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-13-at-11.56.15.png)

Los botones de acceso directo no están disponibles para ejecutar entradas, solo cuando se agrega tiempo manualmente.

Ten en cuenta que esto iniciará  **un nuevo temporizador** con exactamente los mismos detalles que la entrada en la que pulsaste el botón de **reproducción**.

### Deshacer la acción de "eliminar" #

Clockify te permite deshacer entradas eliminadas o descartadas en múltiples pantallas, independientemente de tu rol de usuario o plan de suscripción.

Se muestran claramente en Rastreador de tiempo, Planilla de horarios, Calendario, Gastos, Tiempo libre e Informes.

Para obtener más información, consulta Control de vacaciones y tiempo libre.

Esta función está disponible para todos los usuarios en todos los planes de suscripción.

Los widgets muestran datos en tiempo real y brindan acceso fácil o accesos directos a ciertas acciones para aplicaciones que se ejecutan en dispositivos móviles.

Para utilizar un widget para tu aplicación móvil, generalmente puedes mantener presionado el ícono de una aplicación y elegir la opción **Widgets**.

Están disponibles tres tipos de acciones desde el widget de Clockify:

* Iniciar la entrada de tiempo con temporizador
* Seguir el tiempo de nuevo
* Rastrear el descanso

### Temporizador #

Con este widget, puedes iniciar y detener el temporizador. Después de tocar **reproducir**, el temporizador empieza a funcionar junto con la duración. Cuando se inicie el temporizador, habrá una indicación de si la facturación o la etiqueta están activadas y disponibles para esta entrada de tiempo.

Mientras el temporizador está funcionando, se muestran los siguientes datos de entrada de tiempo:

* Descripción
* Proyecto
* Tarea
* Cliente
* Etiqueta
* Facturable

Si detienes el temporizador y se completan todos los campos obligatorios, esta entrada se añadirá al Rastreador de tiempo. Si no se completan todos los campos obligatorios, se abre la pantalla **Temporizador** y se te pedirá que completes los campos obligatorios.

Los campos personalizados no están disponibles actualmente en los widgets.

### Seguir el tiempo de nuevo #

Este widget muestra las 4 entradas seguidas más recientemente. Puedes elegir una y poner en marcha el temporizador.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/tracking_via_widget_new_logo-461x1024.jpg)

### Rastrear el descanso #

Si has activado el widget, puedes ver el ícono de rastreo de descanso junto con otros íconos en el widget a la hora de registrar el tiempo como un descanso. De esta manera, puedes ver la diferencia entre el seguimiento del tiempo de trabajo y el de descanso sin tener que abrir la aplicación.

En este caso, el tiempo se registra como un tipo de entrada de **descanso**. El widget muestra una taza que lo diferencia del temporizador de entradas de tiempo regular.

Si sueles trabajar en un mismo proyecto, puedes establecer uno por defecto en **Configuración** > pestaña **Espacio de trabajo**. Entonces, cuando inicies el temporizador o añades una entrada de tiempo, el proyecto se seleccionará automáticamente.

Puedes establecer:

* **Proyecto fijo**, que siempre se utilizará cuando inicies un temporizador para una entrada sin proyecto (hasta que cambies el proyecto predeterminado)

Si el **Proyecto predeterminado** está activado, no podrás tener una entrada de tiempo sin proyecto. Además, si editas una entrada antigua sin proyecto, la aplicación la asignará al proyecto predeterminado automáticamente.

### Tema de la app #

Establece un tema de aplicación que seguirá el sistema de la aplicación.

1. Ve a **Configuración** > pestaña **Aplicación**
2. Elige una de las siguientes opciones:
   * Claro
   * Oscuro
   * Predeterminado del sistema

### Modo offline #

Puedes hacer un seguimiento de tiempo en Clockify en tu Android aun si estás sin conexión.

Puedes crear las entradas de tiempo manualmente o iniciar/detener el temporizador. Las entradas creadas así se guardarán localmente en tu teléfono. Cuando vuelvas a conectarte, se sincronizarán automáticamente con tu cuenta en la web.

Cuando estás fuera de línea, solo podrás ver la información que se cargó cuando estuviste conectado (entradas de tiempo, proyectos, tareas, etiquetas, etc.). Por lo tanto, los proyectos, tareas y etiquetas están disponibles solo si se cargaron antes de que te desconectaste.
Una vez que estés desconectado, podrás ver, abrir y editar el gasto, pero los cambios se realizarán una vez que vuelvas a conectarte.

Los nuevos proyectos, tareas, etiquetas y clientes no se pueden crear sin conexión.

Si notas que la aplicación está muy lenta, probablemente significa que tienes una conexión a internet inestable. En ese caso, activa el **Forzar el modo sin conexión**en la Configuración para mejorar el rendimiento. Esto hará que la aplicación funcione como si estuviera offline sin tener que apagar tu internet. Después de desactivar **Forzar el modo sin conexión**, la aplicación sincronizará automáticamente todas las entradas de tiempo.

Si utilizas la aplicación en **modo offline**, asegúrate de sincronizar tus entradas de tiempo con la nube antes de cerrar la sesión. Si no lo haces, todos los datos que no estén sincronizados en el momento de cerrar la sesión se perderán.

Si tu token de acceso caduca mientras estás sin conexión, se cerrará tu sesión cuando te vuelvas a conectar. Los datos no sincronizados se sincronizarán automáticamente y recibirás una notificación si estabas sin conexión.

### Inicio de semana #

Personaliza tu inicio de semana, alinéalo con tus rutinas o prácticas culturales y mejora tu eficiencia.

El inicio de semana predeterminado se configura para todos los miembros del espacio de trabajo en la configuración del espacio de trabajo en la aplicación web. Los propietarios y administradores pueden

### Inicio de día #

Además de personalizar el inicio de tu semana, también puedes personalizar las horas de trabajo y configurar el inicio de tu día.

El inicio de día predeterminado se establece a las **09:00h**.

Para cambiar el inicio de día predeterminado:

Ve a la pantalla **Configuración** y toca la opción **Inicio de día**. Elige tu hora preferida insertando los números, o usa una opción de selector de hora en la esquina inferior izquierda. El selector de hora diferirá según el formato de hora que hayas configurado (12 horas o 24 horas).

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-16-at-14.10.31.png)

El cambio que hayas realizado en la aplicación de Android se aplicará automáticamente a todas las demás plataformas que utilices con la misma cuenta.

Cambiar la hora de inicio de tu jornada laboral en Clockify afectará estas funciones: Planilla de horarios y Tiempo libre.

### Ajustes de zona horaria #

establecer tu zona horaria en la aplicación de Android:

* Elegir la zona horaria manualmente de la lista de zonas horarias disponibles

El cambio que hayas realizado en la aplicación de Android se aplicará automáticamente a todas las demás plataformas que utilices con la misma cuenta.
Además, si configuras una zona horaria que es diferente de la zona horaria establecida en tu dispositivo Android, para realizar un seguimiento del tiempo deberás cambiar la zona horaria en **Configuración del perfil de Clockify** > **Preferencias** > **General** para que coincida con la hora de tu teléfono.

* Establecer zona horaria automáticamente

Si quieres configurar tu zona horaria automáticamente, la aplicación cambiará automáticamente a la zona horaria configurada en tu dispositivo Android. Esta zona horaria se aplicará a todas las plataformas que utilices con la misma cuenta.

Para garantizar la coherencia y la precisión del control del tiempo y las aprobaciones, no podrás cambiar la zona horaria si tienes una solicitud de aprobación pendiente. Una vez que la solicitud sea aprobada/rechazada, podrás modificar la zona horaria.

Temporizador Pomodoro #
-----------------------

El **temporizador Pomodoro** te ayuda a estructurar tu trabajo dividiéndolo en sesiones de trabajo y pausas cronometradas, permitiéndote mantener la concentración y evitar el agotamiento.

### **Cómo funciona**

Una sesión de Pomodoro consta de una **sesión de concentración** (tiempo de trabajo) y una **sesión de descanso** (pausa).

Puedes iniciar un temporizador para una sesión de concentración para empezar con tu trabajo.
Una vez terminada la sesión de concentración, puede comenzar un nuevo temporizador para una sesión de descanso, o puedes iniciar uno manualmente.
Cuando termina la pausa, se detiene el temporizador y puedes continuar con tu trabajo o empezar una nueva tarea.

Para iniciar el temporizador **Pomodoro**:

1. Ve a la página de **Rastreador**
2. Pulsa en **Pomodoro** para pasar a la pestaña de **Pomodoro**
3. Desde aquí, pulsa **Iniciar sesión** para iniciar la sesión inmediatamente

### **Personaliza tus sesiones**

Puedes configurar los ajustes del temporizador Pomodoro para que se adapten a tus necesidades.

* **Establece intervalos** para tus sesiones de concentración y descanso
* **Activa Descansos automáticos** para iniciar un temporizador de descanso tan pronto como termine tu sesión de trabajo
* **Selecciona un proyecto predeterminado** para tus descansos Pomodoro

### **Notificaciones**

Recibirás notificaciones push cuando es hora de iniciar o terminar una sesión, para no tener que estar constantemente pendiente de la aplicación. Incluso puedes iniciar un descanso directamente desde la notificación pulsando **Iniciar descanso**.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screenshot-2025-01-17-at-10.20.28.png)

Si eliges **Aplicar plantilla**, aparecerá una lista de plantillas disponibles. Las plantillas se extraen de sus entradas anteriores.

Si aplicas una plantilla que incluye proyectos o tareas que se eliminaron, archivaron o ya no están accesibles para ti, esos elementos no se agregarán a tu Planilla de horarios actual.

#### Copiar la semana pasada #

Para copiar las tareas y proyectos de la semana pasada en la semana actual, toca el botón **Copiar la semana pasada** ubicado debajo del mensaje de la planilla de horarios, donde generalmente se muestran las entradas de la semana actual.

3. Selecciona el tiempo donde quieres dividir la entrada

Cuando divides una entrada en curso, la primera entrada se detiene en el momento que tu elijas, y una nueva comienza desde ese momento exacto, continuado su ejecución.
Si utilizas el control deslizante, la duración de ambas entradas se ajustará dinámicamente a medida que lo arrastres.

### Modo offline #

Puedes hacer un seguimiento de tiempo en Clockify en tu iPhone incluso si estás sin conexión. Puedes crear las entradas de tiempo manualmente o iniciar/detener el temporizador, y las nuevas entradas creadas así se guardarán localmente en tu teléfono. Cuando vuelvas a conectarte, la aplicación sincronizará automáticamente todas las entradas de tiempo.

Cuando estás fuera de línea, solo podrás ver la información que se cargó cuando estuviste conectado (entradas de tiempo, proyectos, tareas, etiquetas, etc.). Por lo tanto, los proyectos, tareas y etiquetas están disponibles solo si se cargaron antes de que te desconectaste.

Los nuevos proyectos, tareas, etiquetas y clientes no se pueden crear sin conexión.

Si notas que la aplicación está muy lenta, probablemente significa que tienes una conexión a internet inestable. En ese caso, activa el **Forzar el modo sin conexión** en la Configuración para mejorar el rendimiento. Esto hará que la aplicación funcione como si estuviera offline sin tener que apagar tu internet. Después de desactivar **Forzar el m

Puedes crear las entradas de tiempo manualmente o iniciar/detener el temporizador, y las nuevas entradas creadas así se guardarán localmente en tu ordenador. Cuando vuelvas a conectarte, la aplicación sincronizará automáticamente todas las entradas de tiempo.

Los proyectos, tareas y etiquetas no están disponibles sin conexión, por lo tanto, si esos campos se requieren, podrás editar las entradas de tiempo antes de que se sincronicen.

Cuando estás fuera de línea, no podrás ver tus otras entradas de tiempo, sino solo las que se crearon mientras estabas sin conexión y que todavía no se han sincronizado.

Si utilizas la aplicación en **modo offline**, asegúrate de sincronizar tus entradas de tiempo con la nube antes de cerrar la sesión. Si no lo haces, todos los datos que no estén sincronizados en el momento de cerrar la sesión se perderán.

En un esfuerzo por anticipar cualquier problema que puedas encontrar al usar la aplicación, agregamos un menú en la esquina superior izquierda de la aplicación.

Control de tiempo #
-------------------

Puedes mantener un registro de tu tiempo en la aplicación de Clockify para Windows en dos maneras:

* Utiliza el temporizador: Simplemente escribe en qué estás trabajando e inicia el temporizador con un solo clic
* Añade tiempo manualmente: introduce cuánto has trabajado (por ejemplo, 1,5 por 1h30min) y haz clic en **Añadir**

Controla los descansos #
------------------------

Además de realizar un control del tiempo de trabajo, Clockify también te permite controlar los descansos que tomas cuando trabajas en un proyecto.

Todos los usuarios pueden seguir los descansos, independientemente de su función de usuario, si tienen planes de suscripción BÁSICO o superior.

Los descansos se rastrean con un temporizador de descanso que se puede usar si el modo de descanso está habilitado en la configuración del espacio de trabajo en la aplicación web.

Para seguir los descansos:

1. Ve al **Rastreador**
2. Selecciona  **Modo de descanso** desde la configuración en la esquina superior derecha
3. Haz clic en el **ícono de descanso** para empezar a seguir los descansos

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot-2025-07-02-at-09.29.06-1024x322.png)

Las entradas de descanso se pueden modificar y editar de la misma manera que las entradas regulares.

Si:

* El modo de descanso está desactivado o el espacio de trabajo se degrada, todas las entradas de descanso creadas anteriormente permanecen en el rastreador de tiempo
* El modo de descanso + el temporizador Pomodoro están activados, se inicia el descanso Pomodoro

Los descansos se pueden iniciar en modo offline.

Seguimiento de vacaciones y tiempo libre #
------------------------------------------

Además de realizar un seguimiento del tiempo, los gastos y los descansos, también puedes realizar un seguimiento del tiempo libre y las entradas de vacaciones de los miembros de tu espacio de trabajo. Una vez creadas, las entradas de tiempo libre y vacaciones se muestran claramente en las páginas de seguimiento de la aplicación.

Los propietarios y administradores pueden crear entradas de tiempo libre y vacaciones en la aplicación web.

Detección de inactividad #
--------------------------

Si estás rastreando el tiempo mientras trabajas, la función de detección de inactividad existe para ayudarte a comprobar tu actividad. Si el usuario está inactivo durante un cierto período de tiempo y detiene el temporizador, aparece una notificación relacionada con el tiempo cuando el usuario ha estado inactivo. El tiempo de inactividad detecta la actividad del ratón y el teclado y según eso, clasifica el tiempo como inactivo.

**Configura la detección de tiempo de inactividad**:

1. Pincha el botón del **temporizador de Clockify**
2. Abr

, clasifica el tiempo como inactivo.

**Configura la detección de tiempo de inactividad**:

1. Pincha el botón del **temporizador de Clockify**
2. Abre la Configuración
3. Selecciona **Preferencias**
4. Haz clic en la pestaña de **Rastreador del tiempo**
5. Configura el temporizador según tus preferencias
6. Marca la casilla de **Detección de tiempo de inactividad**
7. Escribe el número de minutos después de que se detectará el tiempo inactivo (10 minutos por defecto)

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot-2025-09-22-at-09.38.59-786x1024.png)

Cuando tengas un temporizador en marcha, tu ordenador haya estado inactivo durante el número de minutos seleccionado (sin actividad del ratón o del teclado), y vuelvas al ordenador y muevas el ratón (o escribas en el teclado), recibirás una notificación en la que podrás elegir qué quieres hacer con el tiempo inactivo:

* **Descartar tiempo de inactividad**: el temporizador se detiene y el tiempo de inactividad detectado se elimina de su total
* **Descartar tiempo de inactividad y continuar**:el temporizador se detiene, el tiempo de inactividad detectado se elimina de su total y se inicia inmediatamente un nuevo temporizador para la misma actividad
* **Guardar el tiempo de inactividad**: el temporizador sigue funcionando como está; cierra la pantalla o descarta la notificación para guardar el tiempo de inactivi

* **Añadir tiempo de inactividad como nueva entrada de tiempo**: el temporizador se detiene y el tiempo de inactividad se añade como nueva entrada; se muestran dos entradas de tiempo, siendo la segunda el tiempo durante el cual el usuario ha estado inactivo

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/bg1w6mNpjgjGu3Es-N60qbtNIiyoZ6FRvPODzYR7nGcy4-yj83fVXGl6qYWgTAs15Y6laTy_MPX4cDYSFssEtfjLmT8kC5i5_UQFsC1181pa4Rx4HpQHdvwEQpw0toakvDIGfig0V_-iLAIh4Q)

Si el usuario está haciendo un seguimiento del tiempo y ese tiempo es mayor que el tiempo de inactividad que se estableció, entonces, el tiempo de inactividad se clasifica como el tiempo que transcurre desde que el usuario estaba inactivo hasta que vuelve a estar activo. Por ejemplo, para una entrada de tiempo de 45 minutos, si el tiempo de inactividad se establece en 15 minutos y si el usuario estuvo inactivo durante 30 minutos, estos 30 minutos se calificarán como tiempo de inactividad.

Para encontrar el menú de la aplicación, pulsa el menú en la esquina superior derecha. En este menú puedes:

Temporizador Pomodoro #
-----------------------

Con el temporizador Pomodoro, puedes establecer notificaciones que te avisarán cuando sea la hora de tomar un descanso.

La aplicación Clockify Desktop te enviará una notificación cuando llegues al final de tu intervalo Pomodoro actual para dejarte saber que es hora de tomar una pausa.

Después de la pausa, puedes continuar rastreando el tiempo en la última tarea haciendo clic en el ícono de reproducción en esa entrada de tiempo o iniciando un nuevo temporizador.

Puedes activar solo el temporizador Pomodoro (cuándo detener el temporizador y recibir la notificación), pero también puedes activar los descansos.

Cuando esté habilitado el descanso Pomodoro y llegues al final de tu tiempo Pomodoro, Clockify te dejará saber con una notificación para que detengas el temporizador de la tarea en curso. Después, se inicia un nuevo temporizador, con la descripción “Descanso Pomodoro”. Tras terminarse, el temporizador se detiene y puedes iniciar uno nuevo para lo que quieras.

Puedes iniciar el temporizador para el descanso directamente desde la notificación, haciendo clic en **Iniciar descanso**en la notificación.

Atajos #
--------

Navegar por Clockify es fácil con los atajos de teclado. Estos accesos rápidos de teclado universales no están establecidos por defecto, pero los puedes establecer y configurar tú mismo.

Para configurar los atajos de teclado:

1. Pincha el botón del **temporizador de Clockify**
2. Abre la Configuración
3. Selecciona **Preferencias**
4. Define tus accesos directos en la pestaña **General**

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/shortcuts.png)

Capturas de pantalla #
----------------------

La aplicación de Windows tiene la  función de capturas de pantalla integrada.

Si las capturas de pantalla están habilitadas en la configuración del espacio de trabajo, los usuarios serán informados que la captura de pantalla está activada.

Mientras el temporizador está en marcha, el ícono de la captura de pantalla será de color rojo, indicando que las capturas se toman cada

Soporte offline #
-----------------

Puedes hacer un seguimiento de tiempo en la aplicación de Clockify para Windows aun si estás sin conexión.

Puedes crear las entradas de tiempo manualmente o iniciar/detener el temporizador. Las entradas creadas sin conexión se guardarán localmente en tu ordenador. Cuando vuelvas a conectarte, se sincronizarán con tu cuenta web.

Cuando estás fuera de línea, no podrás ver tus otras entradas de tiempo, sino solo las que se crearon mientras estabas sin conexión y que todavía no se han sincronizado.

Los proyectos, tareas y etiquetas no están disponibles sin conexión.

También puedes activar el modo **Forzar sin conexión** en la Configuración, que puede acelerar la aplicación si tienes una conexión inestable, y posteriormente desactivarlo para sincronizar las entradas.

Si utilizas la aplicación en modo offline, asegúrate de sincronizar tus entradas de tiempo con la nube antes de cerrar la sesión, ya que todos los datos que no estén sincronizados en el momento de cerrar la sesión se perderán.

e fornecem acesso fácil ou atalhos para determinadas ações para aplicativos executados em dispositivos móveis.
Para usar um widget em seu aplicativo móvel, geralmente basta pressionar e segurar o ícone de um aplicativo e escolher a opção **Widgets**.

Três tipos de ações estão disponíveis no widget Clockify:

* Iniciar entrada de tempo com cronômetro
* Rastrear o tempo novamente
* Adicionar tempo (modo manual)

### Cronômetro #

Com este widget, você pode iniciar e parar o cronômetro. Depois de tocar em **reproduzir**, o cronômetro começa a correr junto com a duração. Quando o cronômetro for iniciado, haverá uma indicação se a cobrança ou etiqueta estiver ativada e disponível para esta entrada de tempo.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/widget_new_logo-461x1024.jpg)

Se você tocar em qualquer lugar no widget, a tela do Rastreador se abrirá.

Enquanto o cronômetro está funcionando, os seguintes dados de entrada de tempo são exibidos:

* Descrição
* Projeto
* Tarefa
* Cliente
* Etiqueta
* Faturável

Se você parar o cronômetro e todos os campos obrigatórios estiverem preenchidos, esta entrada será adicionada ao Rastreador de Tempo. Se todos os campos obrigatórios não estiverem preenchidos, a tela **Cronômetro** será aberta e você será solicitado a preencher os campos obrigatórios.

No momento, os campos personalizados não estão disponíveis em widgets.

###


## Chunk 9

* será aberta e você será solicitado a preencher os campos obrigatórios.

No momento, os campos personalizados não estão disponíveis em widgets.

### Rastrear novamente #

Este widget exibe as 4 entradas rastreadas mais recentemente. Você pode escolher um e iniciar o cronômetro.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/tracking_via_widget_new_logo-461x1024.jpg)

Quando você tocar em reproduzir em qualquer uma das entradas, o cronômetro começa novamente. Se você clicar em qualquer lugar dentro do widget, o aplicativo Clockify será aberto. Se você tocar novamente em um widget com uma entrada em execução, o cronômetro será interrompido.

Há um tamanho de widget padrão. No entanto, o widget pode ser redimensionado (reduzir tamanho, ampliar).

Se o cronômetro não tiver todos os campos obrigatórios, os detalhes de entrada de tempo serão abertos para você preencher.

### Adicionar tempo (modo manual) #

Se você ativou o widget, poderá ver um ícone de controle de intervalo ao lado de outros ícones no widget ao controlar o tempo como um intervalo. Dessa forma, você pode ver facilmente a diferença entre monitorar o trabalho e o tempo de intervalo sem precisar abrir o aplicativo.

Neste caso, o tempo é rastreado como um tipo de entrada de **intervalo**. O widget exibe um copo que o diferencia de um cronômetro de entrada de tempo comum.

ockify.

Cronômetro Pomodoro #
---------------------

O  **cronômetro Pomodoro** ajuda você a estruturar seu trabalho dividindo-o em sessões de trabalho cronometrado e intervalos, permitindo que você mantenha o foco e evite o esgotamento.

### **Como funciona**

Uma sessão Pomodoro consiste em uma **sessão de foco** (tempo de trabalho) e uma **sessão de pausa** (pausa).

Você pode iniciar um cronômetro para uma sessão de foco para começar seu trabalho.
Assim que a sessão de foco terminar, um novo cronômetro para uma sessão de intervalo pode iniciar automaticamente, ou você pode iniciar um manualmente.
Quando o intervalo terminar, o cronômetro será interrompido e você poderá continuar seu trabalho ou iniciar uma nova tarefa.

Para iniciar o cronômetro **Pomodoro**:

1. Acesse a página Rastreador
2. Toque em **Pomodoro** para alternar para a aba **Pomodoro**
3. A partir daqui, toque em **Iniciar sessão** para iniciar a sessão imediatamente

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screenshot-2025-09-23-at-10.59.26-538x1024.png)

Você será solicitado a editar os detalhes do foco, incluindo a adição do projeto e alguns detalhes opcionais (descrição, tarefa, tag, faturabilidade, meio período).

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screenshot-2025-09-23-at-10.58.02.png)

### **Personalize suas sessões**

### **Personalize suas sessões**

Você pode configurar as configurações do Cronômetro Pomodoro para corresponder às suas preferências.

* **Defina intervalos** para suas sessões de foco e pausa
* **Ative os intervalos automáticos** para iniciar um cronômetro de intervalo assim que sua sessão de trabalho terminar
* **Escolha um projeto padrão** para suas pausas Pomodoro

### **Notificações**

Você receberá notificações push quando for a hora de iniciar ou encerrar uma sessão, para não precisar ficar de olho no aplicativo. Você pode até iniciar um intervalo diretamente na notificação tocando em **Iniciar intervalo**.

O suporte para widgets legados foi descontinuado no **iOS 18 e versões posteriores**.

Você pode iniciar e parar rapidamente o cronômetro do seu telefone sem precisar abrir o aplicativo. O widget facilita a troca de tempo entre as tarefas para que você possa acompanhar o tempo com um único toque. Basta clicar no projeto para adicionar o tempo a ele e alterar os projetos clicando em outro projeto.

Você também pode iniciar/parar o último cronômetro com **toque háptico** (toque 3D) ao pressionar e segurar o ícone do aplicativo.

**Como adicionar um widget à sua tela inicial:**

1. Vá para a tela de widgets no seu iOS (tela à esquerda da tela inicial)
2. Vá para a parte inferior da tela e toque em **

Modo de Planilha #
------------------

Você pode registrar quanto tempo gastou em projetos para cada dia da semana na Planilha de horas (Planilha de horas precisa ser habilitada nas configurações do espaço de trabalho primeiro).

Crie o modelo da seguinte maneira:

1. Adicione um projeto/tarefa
2. Pressione no campo ao lado do projeto adicionado para o dia em que deseja registrar o tempo
3. Digite o tempo
4. Quando uma nova semana começar, você pode reutilizar a combinação de projeto/tarefa da semana passada ou usar um modelo

Atividades semanais de preenchimento automático

Dependendo do período de aprovação definido nas **configurações do espaço de trabalho**, podem ser criados modelos de Planilha de horas para períodos semanais, semestrais e mensais.

### Modelo de planilha de horas #

Se você estiver trabalhando em um projeto complexo que dura muito tempo e muitas vezes precisa inserir as mesmas entradas de horário em sua planilha de horas, você pode configurar um modelo para economizar tempo e reutilizá-lo sempre que precisar.

Para definir a planilha de horas como modelo:

1. Abra a tela **Planilha de horas** no aplicativo
2. Abaixo da lista de entradas rastreadas, você terá as seguintes opções:
   * **Enviar para aprovação**
   * **Criar**/**Aplicar modelo**
     ou
   * **Copiar a semana anterior**

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screenshot-2025-01-17-at-10.20.28.png)

Se você escolher **Aplicar modelo**, será exibida uma lista de modelos disponíveis. Os modelos são extraídos de entradas anteriores.

Se você aplicar um modelo que inclua projetos ou tarefas que foram excluídos, arquivados ou que não estão mais acessíveis para você, esses itens não serão adicionados a sua Planilha de horas atual.

#### Copiar


## Chunk 12

foram excluídos, arquivados ou que não estão mais acessíveis para você, esses itens não serão adicionados a sua Planilha de horas atual.

#### Copiar a semana anterior #

Para copiar as tarefas e projetos da semana passada para a semana atual, toque no botão **Copiar a semana anterior** botão localizado abaixo do prompt da planilha de horas, onde as entradas da semana atual normalmente são exibidas.

Esta opção aparecerá se você não tiver entradas para a semana atual. Se você já adicionou entradas, a opção não estará visível.

#### Modo off-line #

Se estiver off-line, você ainda poderá salvar um modelo. Quando estiver on-line novamente, você poderá aplicar o modelo salvo.

Editar entrada #
----------------

Para editar uma entrada de tempo, toque na tela do Rastreador. Se o cronômetro estiver em execução, você poderá editar os detalhes dessa entrada tocando no cronômetro.

Na tela **Editar detalhes da entrada** você pode:

* Editar a hora de início e término, bem como a data
* Selecionar tarefa e projeto (além de criar projetos, tarefas e clientes do aplicativo)
* Editar descrição do tempo
* Marcar entrada de tempo como faturável
* Adicionar/excluir etiquetas (bem como criá-las)

Membros regulares (não administradores) da equipe não poderão criar clientes, projetos e tags se não tiverem essas permissões. Para conceder essas permissões, você precisará fazer login pelo navegador


## Chunk 13

não poderão criar clientes, projetos e tags se não tiverem essas permissões. Para conceder essas permissões, você precisará fazer login pelo navegador da web e definir **Quem pode criar projetos e clientes**, **Quem pode criar tarefas** e **Quem pode criar tags** como **Qualquer pessoa** nas configurações do Workspace.

Cada vez que você edita algo, o Clockify salva as alterações e sincroniza os dados automaticamente.

### Subdividir entradas de tempo #

Ao controlar o tempo pelo Clockify em um celular, você pode dividir uma entrada em segmentos menores nas páginas **Controlador de tempo** e **Calendário** e controlar o tempo com mais precisão e flexibilidade.

Este recurso está disponível para todos os usuários em um plano pago e teste gratuito.

#### Como funciona #

1. Encontre a entrada que deseja dividir na página **Rastreador de tempo** ou **Calendário**
2. Escolha a opção de dividir a entrada
   ![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screenshot-2025-09-23-at-10.41.21.png)
3. Escolha o horário em que deseja dividir a entrada

Quando você divide uma entrada em execução, a primeira entrada para no ponto escolhido e uma nova começa a partir desse exato momento, continuando a ser executada.
Se você usar um controle deslizante de linha do tempo, a duração de ambas as entradas será ajustada dinamicamente conforme você as arrasta.

![](https://clockify.me/help/w


## Chunk 14

ole deslizante de linha do tempo, a duração de ambas as entradas será ajustada dinamicamente conforme você as arrasta.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/image.png)

Entradas de tempo com menos de 2 minutos de duração não podem ser divididas.

### Excluir entrada #

Para excluir uma entrada, volte para a tela do **Controlador de Tempo**, deslize para a esquerda na entrada de tempo e toque em **Excluir**.

Você também pode excluir entradas agrupadas da mesma maneira.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screenshot-2025-08-20-at-10.47.09.png)

Se quiser ver entradas semelhantes agrupadas, vá para a aba **Preferências** > **Geral** no aplicativo web e ative **Agrupar entradas semelhantes**.

### Desfazer ação ‘excluir’ #

Se você estiver em um **Controlador de Tempo**, **Planilha de Ponto**, **Calendário** ou **Despesas**, poderá recuperar as entradas excluídas. Com a ação de desfazer "excluir", você pode reverter rapidamente ações como excluir entradas ou despesas e descartar um cronômetro em execução.

Esta ferramenta está disponível para todos os usuários, independentemente do plano ou função. Você pode usá-lo independentemente de estar em um plano de teste ou pago.

#### Desfazer entradas excluídas #

* **Rastreador de tempo**
  + Deslize para a esquerda em uma entrada

iver desconectado. Você pode criar as entradas de tempo manualmente ou iniciar/parar o cronômetro, e as novas entradas criadas desta forma serão salvas localmente em seu telefone. Quando você se reconectar, o aplicativo vai sincronizar automaticamente todas as entradas de tempo.

Quando estiver desconectado, você só poderá ver as informações que foram carregadas quando você estava online (registros de tempo, projetos, tarefas, etiquetas etc.). Portanto, projetos, tarefas e etiquetas estarão disponíveis apenas se tiverem sido carregados antes de você ficar desconectado.

Novos projetos, tarefas, etiquetas e clientes não podem ser criados offline.

Se você notar que o aplicativo está muito lento, provavelmente significa que sua conexão de internet está instável. Nesse caso, ative **Forçar modo offline** nas Configurações para melhorar o desempenho. Isso fará com que o aplicativo se comporte como se estivesse offline sem que você precise desligar a conexão de internet. Após desativar **Forçar modo offline**, o aplicativo sincronizará automaticamente todas as entradas de tempo.

Se você estiver usando o aplicativo no **modo offline**, certifique-se de sincronizar suas entradas de tempo com a nuvem antes de sair. Caso contrário, todos os dados que não estiverem sincronizados no momento do logout serão perdidos.

## Chunk 17

que avisarão quando for a hora de fazer uma pausa.

O aplicativo Clockify Desktop enviará uma notificação quando você atingir o final do seu intervalo Pomodoro atual, lembrando que é hora de fazer uma pausa.

Após o intervalo, você pode continuar rastreando o tempo na última tarefa clicando no ícone de reprodução nessa entrada de tempo ou iniciando um novo cronômetro.

Você pode definir apenas o cronômetro Pomodoro (quando parar o cronômetro e enviar uma notificação) e também pode definir intervalos.

Quando o intervalo do Pomodoro estiver ativado e você chegar ao fim do seu tempo de Pomodoro, o Clockify avisará você com uma notificação para interromper o cronômetro da tarefa atual. Em seguida, um novo cronômetro é iniciado, com a descrição “Intervalo Pomodoro”. Depois de terminar, o cronômetro pára e você pode iniciar um novo para o que quiser.

Você pode iniciar o cronômetro de intervalo diretamente na notificação clicando em **Iniciar intervalo** na notificação.

Você pode habilitar o timer Pomodoro e definir seus intervalos preferidos de Pomodoro e pausa em Preferências > aba Cronômetro.

----------------

Se você trabalha no mesmo projeto todos os dias, defina um projeto padrão. Então, tudo o que você precisa fazer é digitar no que está trabalhando e iniciar o cronômetro, e o projeto será selecionado automaticamente.

Você pode escolher:

* **Um projeto fixo**, que sempre será usado quando você iniciar um cronômetro para uma entrada não relacionada ao projeto (até que você altere o projeto padrão)
* **Último projeto usado**, e o cronômetro usará o último projeto disponível da sua lista de entradas de tempo

Você pode ativar o projeto padrão nas configurações do aplicativo.

Captura de tela #

Detecção de inatividade #
-------------------------

Se você estiver rastreando o tempo enquanto trabalha, o recurso de detecção de inatividade existe para ajudá-lo a verificar sua atividade. Se o usuário estiver inativo por um determinado período de tempo e você parar o cronômetro, uma notificação relacionada ao tempo aparecerá quando o usuário estiver inativo. O tempo de inatividade é detectado com base na atividade do mouse e do teclado, que se não for usado por um certo tempo, será classificado como inativo.

**Configure a detecção de tempo de inatividade**:

1. Clique no botão do **cronômetro Clockify**
2. Abra configurações
3. Selecione **Preferências**
4. Clique na aba **Rastreamento** de tempo
5. Defina o cronômetro de acordo com suas preferências
6. Marque a caixa **Detecção de tempo de inatividade**
7. Digite o número de minutos após o tempo de inatividade ser detectado (10 minutos por padrão)

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot-2025-09-22-at-09.38.59-786x1024.png)

Quando você tiver um cronômetro em execução, e seu computador estiver inativo pelo número de minutos selecionado (sem atividade de mouse ou teclado), ao retornar ao computador e mover o mouse (ou digitar no teclado), você receberá uma notificação informando o que deseja fazer com o tempo ocioso:

* **Descartar tempo inativo**: O cronômetro é interrompido e o tempo ocioso


## Chunk 15

ceberá uma notificação informando o que deseja fazer com o tempo ocioso:

* **Descartar tempo inativo**: O cronômetro é interrompido e o tempo ocioso é removido do seu total.
* **Descartar o tempo inativo e continuar:**O cronômetro atual é interrompido, o tempo inativo é removido do seu total e um novo cronômetro é iniciado imediatamente para a mesma atividade.
* **Manter o tempo inativo**: O cronômetro continua funcionando como está, feche a tela ou ignore a notificação para manter o tempo de inatividade no aplicativo.
* **Adicionar tempo ocioso como uma nova entrada de tempo:** O cronômetro é interrompido e o tempo inativo é adicionado como uma nova entrada de tempo; duas entradas de tempo aparecem, sendo a segunda o tempo que o usuário está inativo.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/bg1w6mNpjgjGu3Es-N60qbtNIiyoZ6FRvPODzYR7nGcy4-yj83fVXGl6qYWgTAs15Y6laTy_MPX4cDYSFssEtfjLmT8kC5i5_UQFsC1181pa4Rx4HpQHdvwEQpw0toakvDIGfig0V_-iLAIh4Q)

Se o usuário estiver rastreando o tempo e ele for maior que o tempo inativo definido previamente, o tempo inativo será classificado como o tempo desde que o usuário estava ocioso até que ele esteja ativo novamente, por exemplo, para uma entrada de tempo de 45 minutos, se o tempo inativo for definido como 15 minutos e se o usuário estiver inativo por 30 minutos, esses 30 minutos serão considerados como tempo inativo.

Cronômetro Pomodoro #
---------------------

Com o cronômetro Pomodoro, você pode configurar notificações que avisarão quando for a hora de fazer uma pausa.

O aplicativo de desktop Clockify enviará uma notificação quando você chegar ao final do intervalo Pomodoro atual para avisar que deve fazer uma pausa.

Após o intervalo, você pode continuar acompanhando o tempo da última tarefa clicando no ícone de reprodução dessa entrada ou iniciar um novo cronômetro.

Você pode definir apenas o cronômetro Pomodoro (quando parar o cronômetro e enviar uma notificação) e também pode definir intervalos.

Quando o intervalo do Pomodoro estiver ativado e o tempo do Pomodoro expirar, o Clockify enviará uma notificação para interromper o cronômetro da tarefa atual. Em seguida, um novo cronômetro será iniciado, com a descrição “Intervalo Pomodoro”. Quando a pausa terminar, o cronômetro será interrompido e você poderá iniciar um no


## Chunk 17

vo cronômetro será iniciado, com a descrição “Intervalo Pomodoro”. Quando a pausa terminar, o cronômetro será interrompido e você poderá iniciar um novo para qualquer outra atividade.

Você pode iniciar o cronômetro para o intervalo diretamente na notificação clicando em **Iniciar intervalo**na notificação.

Você pode habilitar o cronômetro Pomodoro e definir seus intervalos preferidos de Pomodoro e pausa em Preferências > aba **Rastreador**.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/pomodoro-timer-window-1.png)

Atalhos #
---------

Navegar pelo Clockify é fácil com atalhos. Nossos atalhos de teclado universal não são definidos por padrão, mas você mesmo pode defini-los e configurá-los.

Para configurar atalhos:

1. Clique no botão do **cronômetro Clockify**
2. Abra configurações
3. Selecione **Preferências**
4. Defina seus atalhos globais na guia **Geral**

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/shortcuts.png)

Você pode definir atalhos para mostrar e ocultar o aplicativo ou continuar e parar o cronômetro.

Captura de tela #
-----------------

O aplicativo do Windows possui uma ferramenta de captura de tela  integrada.

Se as capturas de tela estiverem ativadas nas configurações do espaço de trabalho, os usuários serão informados de que as capturas de tela estão ativadas.

Enquanto o cronômetro estiver em execução, o ícone de captura de tela fi


## Chunk 18

lho, os usuários serão informados de que as capturas de tela estão ativadas.

Enquanto o cronômetro estiver em execução, o ícone de captura de tela ficará vermelho, indicando que as capturas de tela são feitas a cada 5 minutos.

Suporte offline #
-----------------

Você pode rastrear o tempo no aplicativo Clockify para Windows, mesmo se estiver offline.

Você pode criar entradas de tempo manualmente ou iniciar/parar o cronômetro. As entradas criadas off-line serão salvas localmente no seu computador. Quando você se reconectar, elas serão sincronizadas com sua conta da web.

Quando estiver offline, não poderá ver outras entradas de tempo, apenas aquelas que foram criadas enquanto você estava offline e ainda não foram sincronizadas.

Projetos, tarefas e etiquetas não estão disponíveis offline.

Você também pode ativar o modo **Forçar offline** em Configurações, o que pode acelerar o aplicativo se você tiver uma conexão instável e em seguida, desativá-lo para sincronizar as entradas.

Se você usar o aplicativo no modo offline, certifique-se de sincronizar suas entradas de tempo com a nuvem antes de sair, pois todos os dados que não forem sincronizados no momento de sair serão perdidos.

* Exibir a tecla de atalho do aplicativo
* Ocultar no Dock
* Mostrar cronômetro e/ou projeto na barra de status
* Selecionar o tema (claro ou escuro)
* Definir o projeto padrão
* Definir um atalho global personalizado
* Alterar as configurações do cronômetro
* Exibir a cor do projeto na barra de status

Parar e iniciar o cronômetro automaticamente
--------------------------------------------

Se você costuma esquecer de parar o cronômetro quando faz uma pausa ou ao terminar o trabalho, o aplicativo para Mac pode parar o cronômetro automaticamente para você.

O aplicativo também pode iniciar o cronômetro automaticamente quando você voltar ao trabalho, eliminando a necessidade de gerenciá-lo manualmente.

Em Preferências > Cronômetro, você pode selecionar em quais casos Clockify deve iniciar e/ou parar o cronômetro automaticamente:

* Quando o Mac entrar em repouso, desligar ou a tampa for fechada (bloqueio da tela)
* Quando o Mac for ativado, desbloqueado ou quando o aplicativo for iniciado

Cronômetro Pomodoro
-------------------

Com o cronômetro Pomodoro, você pode configurar notificações que avisam quando é hora de fazer uma pausa.

O aplicativo Clockify Desktop enviará uma notificação quando você atingir o final do seu intervalo Pomodoro atual, lembrando que é hora de fazer uma pausa.

Após o intervalo, você pode continuar acompanhando o tempo da última tarefa clicando no ícone de reprodução dessa entrada ou iniciar um novo cronômetro.

Você pode ativar apenas o Cronômetro Pomodoro (definindo quando o cronômetro deve parar e enviar uma notificação), ou também configurar intervalos.

Quando o intervalo do Pomodoro estiver ativado e o tempo do Pomodoro expirar, o Clockify enviará uma notificação para interromper o cronômetro da tarefa atual. Em seguida, um novo cronômetro será iniciado, com a descrição “Intervalo Pomodoro”. Quando a pausa terminar, o cronômetro será interrompido e você poderá iniciar um novo para qualquer outra atividade.

Você pode iniciar o cronômetro para o intervalo diretamente na notificação clicando em **Iniciar intervalo**na notificação.

Ative o Cronômetro Pomodoro e defina seus intervalos em Preferências > Aba Cronômetro.

Projeto padrão
--------------

Se você trabalha no mesmo projeto todos os dias, defina um projeto padrão. Assim, tudo o que você precisa fazer é digitar no que está trabalhando e iniciar o cronômetro, e o projeto será selecionado automaticamente.

Você pode escolher:

* **Projeto fixo**, que sempre será usado ao iniciar um cronômetro para uma entrada sem projeto (até que você altere o projeto padrão)
* **Último projeto usado**, onde o cronômetro selecionará automaticamente o projeto mais recente utilizado da sua lista de entradas de tempo

Você pode habilitar o projeto padrão em Configurações > Aba Geral do aplicativo.

Atalhos de teclado
------------------

Quando a janela do Clockify estiver ativa, você pode usar atalhos de teclado para executar ações rapidamente:

* Cmd+S – Iniciar o cronômetro
* Cmd+T – Parar o cronômetro
* Cmd+N – Entrar no modo de entrada de tempo manual
* Cmd + Shift + S – Salvar a entrada de tempo ao editar
* Cmd+D – Descartar o cronômetro
* Cmd+Y – Sincronizar dados
* Cmd+L – Fazer logout (Sair)

Você também pode definir seus próprios atalhos globais para iniciar/parar o cronômetro e exibir/ocultar o aplicativo em Configurações > Preferências > Geral.

Suporte offline

## Chunk 10

atalhos globais para iniciar/parar o cronômetro e exibir/ocultar o aplicativo em Configurações > Preferências > Geral.

Suporte offline
---------------

Você pode rastrear o tempo no aplicativo Clockify no seu Mac, mesmo offline.

Você pode criar entradas de tempo manualmente ou iniciar/parar o cronômetro normalmente. As novas entradas de tempo serão salvas localmente no seu computador. Quando você voltar a ficar online, o aplicativo sincronizará automaticamente todas as entradas.

Quando estiver offline, você só poderá visualizar as informações carregadas enquanto estiver online (registros de tempo, projetos, tarefas, etiquetas, etc). Projetos, tarefas e etiquetas estarão disponíveis para seleção se tiverem sido carregados antes de você ficar offline.

Novos projetos, tarefas, etiquetas e clientes não podem ser criados offline.

O aplicativo armazena dados localmente e sincroniza com a versão web quando você estiver online novamente. Se desejar, também pode sincronizar manualmente clicando no ícone de atualização.

Se você usar o aplicativo no **modo off-line**, certifique-se de sincronizar suas entradas de tempo com a nuvem antes de sair da conta. Caso contrário, todos os dados não sincronizados serão perdidos ao fazer logout.

3. Adicione o aplicativo à lista

Para abrir o aplicativo na mesma página em que você estava quando o fechou, mantenha a opção **Fechar janelas ao sair de um aplicativo** desmarcada em Preferências do sistema > Geral.

Se você esquecer de iniciar o cronômetro manualmente, o Clockify pode iniciá-lo automaticamente quando seu Mac for desbloqueado, despertado ou ligado. Ou, se esquecer de parar o cronômetro, o Clockify pode interrompê-lo automaticamente quando seu Mac for bloqueado, entrar em repouso ou for desligado.
A inicialização e a parada automáticas podem ser habilitadas em Preferências > Cronômetro.

Les durées suivantes peuvent être ajoutées :

La valeur affichée sur les boutons de raccourci est basée sur la durée de l'entrée (par exemple, si la durée est inférieure à une heure, le bouton -1 est désactivé).
Cliquez sur l'un des boutons, et cette valeur sera ajoutée/soustraite du temps suivi.

2. Tap on **Notifications**
3. Here, you can enable the type of notifications you want to receive:
   1. Time off: alerts for time off requests
   2. Scheduling: alerts about scheduling changes

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-2025-10-23-at-11.22.15.png)

Essential notifications (e.g. start/stop reminders, approvals) are turned on by default. You can change these settings at any time. If you are in offline mode, your notification will be disabled.

### Timer reminders #

Set up push notifications to remind you to start or stop your timer on specific days and times.

#### Enable reminders #

To enable and customize reminders:

1. Go to the main menu and open **App** tab

### Mode hors connexion #

Vous pouvez suivre votre temps dans Clockify sur votre Android même si vous n'êtes pas en ligne.

Créez des entrées de temps manuellement ou lancez/arrêtez le minuteur. Les entrées effectuées hors ligne seront sauvegardées localement sur votre téléphone. Une fois que vous serez de nouveau en ligne, elles seront automatiquement synchronisées avec votre compte web.

Lorsque vous êtes hors ligne, vous ne pourrez voir que les informations chargées lorsque vous étiez en ligne (entrées de temps, projets, tâches, étiquettes, etc.). Ainsi, les projets, les tâches et les balises sont disponibles pour la sélection s'ils ont été chargés avant que vous ne soyez déconnecté.
Lorsque vous n'êtes pas en ligne, vous pouvez voir, ouvrir et modifier la dépense, mais les changements seront effectués une fois que vous serez de

.
Lorsque vous n'êtes pas en ligne, vous pouvez voir, ouvrir et modifier la dépense, mais les changements seront effectués une fois que vous serez de nouveau en ligne.

Il n'est pas possible de créer de nouveaux projets, tâches, balises et clients lorsque vous êtes hors ligne.

Si vous remarquez que l'application est très lente, cela signifie probablement que votre connexion Internet est instable. Dans ce cas, activez le mode **Forcer le mode hors ligne**dans les paramètres pour améliorer les performances. L'application se comportera ainsi comme si elle était hors ligne sans que vous ayez à désactiver votre connexion Internet. Une fois que vous aurez désactivé le mode **Forcer le mode hors ligne**, l'application synchronisera automatiquement toutes les entrées de temps.

Si vous utilisez l’appli en **mode hors connexion**, veillez à synchroniser vos saisies de temps avec le cloud avant de vous déconnecter, afin d’éviter la perte des données non synchronisées.

Si votre jeton d'accès expire alors que vous êtes hors ligne, vous serez déconnecté lorsque vous vous reconnecterez. Les données non synchronisées seront automatiquement synchronisées et vous serez averti si vous étiez hors ligne.

## Chunk 5

: Faites glisser vers le haut à partir du milieu de l’écran

Lors de la création manuelle d’une saisie de temps, les heures de début et de fin par défaut sont automatiquement renseignées, ce qui vous évite de les saisir systématiquement. Néanmoins, vous avez la possibilité de les modifier facilement en entrant les heures de début et de fin souhaitées.

Clockify se synchronise automatiquement chaque fois que vous effectuez une action. En cas de déconnexion, l’appli se synchronisera dès que vous serez en ligne. Si aucune action n’est effectuée, une synchronisation manuelle est nécessaire en faisant glisser le curseur vers le bas depuis le centre de l’écran.

Clockify regroupe les saisies de temps similaires sous une seule saisie extensible. Si vous souhaitez voir les saisies dans l’ordre chronologique, rendez-vous dans l’onglet **Préférences > Général** de l’appli web et désactivez l’option **Regrouper les saisies similaires**.

If there is a newly created event in your calendar, go to the Calendar screen and wait for the events to sync. After the sync is done, you’ll be able to see them in Clockify.

Minuteur Pomodoro #
-------------------

**Pomodoro timer** helps you structure your work by breaking it into timed work and break sessions, allowing you to stay focused and avoid burnout.

### **Comment cela fonctionne**

A Pomodoro session consists of a **focus session** (work time) and a **break session** (break).

You can start a timer for a focus session to begin your work.
Once the focus session ends, a new timer for a break session can start automatically, or you can start one manually.
When the break ends, the timer will stop, and you can continue your work or start a new task.

To start the **Pomodoro** timer:

1. Accédez à la page **Suivi du temps**
2. Tap


## Chunk 9

imer will stop, and you can continue your work or start a new task.

To start the **Pomodoro** timer:

1. Accédez à la page **Suivi du temps**
2. Tap on **Pomodoro** to switch to **Pomodoro** tab
3. From here, tap on **Start session** to start the session immediately

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screenshot-2025-09-23-at-10.59.26-538x1024.png)

You’ll be prompted to edit focus details including adding project and some optional details (description, task, tag, billability, part-time).

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screenshot-2025-09-23-at-10.58.02.png)

### **Customize your sessions**

You can set up the Pomodoro timer settings to match your preferences.

* **Set intervals** for your focus and break sessions
* **Turn on Automatic breaks** to start a break timer as soon as your work session ends
* **Choose a default project** for your Pomodoro breaks

### **Notifications**

You’ll receive push notifications when it’s time to start or end a session, so you don’t have to constantly watch the app. You can even start a break directly from the notification by tapping **Start break**.

La prise en charge des anciens widgets a été supprimée dans **iOS 18 et les versions ultérieures**.

Auto-remplissage des activités hebdomadaires

En fonction de la période d'approbation définie dans les **Paramètres de l'espace de travail**, des modèles de feuilles de temps peuvent être créés pour des périodes hebdomadaires, bimensuelles et mensuelles.

### Modèle de feuille de temps #

Si vous travaillez sur un projet complexe et de longue haleine et que vous devez fréquemment saisir les mêmes heures dans votre feuille de temps, vous pouvez créer un modèle. Cela vous permettra de gagner du temps en réutilisant le modèle chaque fois que nécessaire.

Pour définir la feuille de temps comme modèle :

1. Ouvrez l'écran **Feuille de temps** dans l'application
2. Sous la liste des entrées suivies, vous disposez des options suivantes :
   * **Soumettre pour approbation**
   * **Créer**/**Appliquer un modèle**

   * **Copier la semaine précédente**

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screenshot-2025-01-17-at-10.20.28.png)

Si vous choisissez **Appliquer un modèle**, une liste des modèles disponibles s'affiche. Les modèles sont extraits de vos précédentes saisies.

Si les projets ou tâches inclus dans un modèle ne sont plus disponibles (supprimés, archivés ou inaccessibles), ils ne seront pas ajoutés à votre feuille de temps actuelle.

#### Copier la semaine précédente #

Pour copier les tâches et les projets de la semaine précédente dans la semaine en cours, appuyez sur le bouton **Copier la semaine précédente** situé sous l'invite de la feuille de temps, où les saisies de la semaine en cours sont généralement affichées.

Cette option apparaîtra si vous n’avez aucune saisie pour la semaine en cours. Si vous avez déjà ajouté des saisies, l’option ne sera pas visible.

## Chunk 13

Si vous n'êtes pas en ligne, vous pouvez toujours enregistrer un modèle. Une fois de nouveau en ligne, vous pourrez appliquer le modèle sauvegardé.

Modifier la saisie #
--------------------

Pour modifier une saisie de temps, appuyez dessus depuis l’écran de suivi du temps. Si le minuteur est actif, vous pouvez également modifier les détails de cette saisie de temps en appuyant sur le minuteur lui-même.

Dans l’écran **Modifier les détails de la saisie**, vous pouvez :

* Modifier l'heure de début et de fin, ainsi que la date
* Sélectionner la tâche et le projet (vous pouvez également créer des projets, des tâches et des clients à partir de l'appli)
* Modifier la description du temps
* Marquer la saisie de temps comme facturable
* Ajouter/supprimer des balises (et en créer)

Les membres d’équipe non-administrateurs ne peuvent pas créer de clients, de projets ou de balises, à moins que ces autorisations ne leur aient été accordées. Pour ce faire, un administrateur doit se connecter via un navigateur Web et définir les paramètres de l’espace de travail **Qui peut créer des projets et des clients**, **Qui peut créer des tâches** et **Qui peut créer des balises** sur **Tout le monde**.

Chaque fois que vous modifiez quelque chose, Clockify enregistre automatiquement les changements et synchronise les données.

z quelque chose, Clockify enregistre automatiquement les changements et synchronise les données.

### Diviser les saisies de temps #

When tracking time via Clockify on a mobile, you can split and divide an entry into smaller segments on the **Time tracker** and **Calendar** pages and track time with more accuracy and flexibility.

This feature is available to all users on a paid plan and free trial.

#### Comment cela fonctionne #

1. Find the entry you want to split on the **Time tracker** or **Calendar** page
2. Choose the option to split the entry
   ![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screenshot-2025-09-23-at-10.41.21.png)
3. Choose the time where you want to split the entry

When you split a running entry, the first entry stops at the point you choose, and a new one starts from that exact moment, continuing to run.
If you use a timeline slider, the duration of both entries will dynamically adjust as you drag it.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/image.png)

Time entries that are less than 2 minutes long cannot be split.

### Supprimer une saisie de temps #

Pour supprimer une saisie, retournez à l’écran **Suivi du temps**, balayez vers la gauche sur la saisie de temps, puis appuyez sur **Supprimer**.

Vous pouvez également supprimer des saisies groupées de la même manière.

Vous pouvez également supprimer des saisies groupées de la même manière.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screenshot-2025-08-20-at-10.47.09.png)

Si vous souhaitez regrouper les saisies similaires, accédez à l’onglet **Préférences > Général** dans l’appli Web et activez l’option **Regrouper les saisies similaires**.

### Annuler l’action « Supprimer » #

Si vous travaillez sur un **suivi du temps**, une **feuille de temps**, un **calendrier** ou des **dépenses**, vous avez la possibilité de restaurer les saisies précédemment supprimées. La fonctionnalité **Annuler la suppression** vous permet d’annuler rapidement des actions telles que la suppression de saisies ou de dépenses, ainsi que l’annulation d’un minuteur actif.

Cette fonctionnalité est accessible à tous les utilisateurs, qu’ils soient en période d’essai, abonnés à un plan payant ou quel que soit leur rôle.

#### Annuler les saisies supprimées #

* **Suivi du temps**
  + Glissez vers la gauche sur une saisie
  + Appuyez sur **Supprimer**
  + Le message « Saisie supprimée » s'affiche avec l'option **Annuler**

* **Calendrier**
  + Appuyez sur la saisie
  + Appuyez sur **Supprimer**
  + Un message contextuel indique « Saisie supprimée »
  + Appuyez sur **Annuler** pour rétablir la saisie

#### Annuler les dépenses supprimées #

* **Dépenses**
  + Supprimez une dépense
  + Le message « Dépenses supprimées » s'affiche
  + Appuyez sur **Annuler** pour les restaurer

Le message de confirmation de suppression s’affiche pendant 5 secondes. Il restera visible sur l’écran actuel, même si vous naviguez vers un autre écran, jusqu’à ce que vous le fermiez manuellement ou qu’il disparaisse automatiquement après 5 secondes.

#### Mode hors connexion #

La fonctionnalité d’annulation est disponible en mode hors ligne, mais seulement pour les saisies créées lorsque vous étiez déconnecté. Si vous annulez une action effectuée en ligne alors que vous êtes hors ligne, le message d’annulation disparaîtra.

Suivre les pauses #
-------------------

Pour analyser et optimiser le temps que vous consacrez à vos pauses, vous avez la possibilité de les suivre via le suivi du temps sur votre appareil iOS.

Le minuteur de pause est accessible à tous les utilisateurs, quel que soit leur rôle. Pour l’activer, il suffit d’aller dans les paramètres de l’espace de travail de l’appli web.

3. Le bouton de la pause (icône de la tasse) apparaît, vous êtes maintenant en **Mode Pause**
4. Commencez la pause en appuyant sur le bouton

Chaque saisie de pause inclut les mêmes informations qu’une saisie de temps standard : heure de début et de fin, durée, nom du projet, statut facturable (ou non) et, si applicable, des champs personnalisés.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screenshot-2025-06-26-at-12.36.01-470x1024.png)

Vous pouvez toujours modifier et supprimer les saisies de pause, sauf si la période est verrouillée et que les saisies de temps sont approuvées.

**Important à noter**

* Si le suivi des pauses est désactivé ou si l'espace de travail est passé à un plan inférieur, les saisies de pauses suivies restent dans le suivi du temps
* Si le minuteur de force est activé, vous ne pouvez pas changer de mode et vous ne pouvez lancer le minuteur qu'en appuyant sur lecture
* Si le mode pause est activé, lo

* Si le mode pause est activé, lorsque vous dupliquez ou poursuivez la saisie de pause, une nouvelle saisie de pause est créée
* Si le mode pause est désactivé, lorsque vous dupliquez ou poursuivez la saisie de la pause, une saisie de la pause normale est créée
* Le minuteur de pause est disponible en mode hors ligne
* Le format de durée défini dans les paramètres de l'espace de travail, sur l'appli web, sera appliqué

Suivre les jours fériés et les congés #
---------------------------------------

Outre le suivi du temps, des dépenses et des pauses, vous pouvez également suivre les congés et les jours fériés des membres de votre espace de travail.

Les propriétaires et les administrateurs peuvent créer des saisies relatives aux congés et aux jours fériés dans l’appli Web.

Ils sont affichés distinctement sur toutes les pages de suivi :

* Suivi du temps
* Feuille de temps
* Calendrier
* Dépenses
* Congés
* Rapports

Pour plus d’informations sur la création de saisies relatives aux congés et aux jours fériés, consultez cet article.

* Ou sélectionner **Dernier projet utilisé**, et le minuteur choisira le projet disponible le plus récemment utilisé dans votre liste de saisies de temps

### Mode hors connexion #

Vous avez la possibilité de suivre votre temps dans Clockify sur votre iPhone, même sans connexion Internet. Vous pouvez enregistrer vos saisies de temps manuellement ou utiliser la fonction de démarrage/arrêt du minuteur. Toutes les saisies effectuées hors ligne seront stockées localement sur votre téléphone et synchronisées automatiquement avec l’appli dès que vous serez de nouveau en ligne.

En mode hors ligne, seules les données précédemment chargées (saisies de temps, projets, tâches, étiquettes, etc.) sont visibles. Par conséquent, les projets, tâches et balises ne peuvent être sélectionnés que s’ils ont été chargés avant la déconnexion.

Il n'est pas possible de créer de nouveaux projets, tâches, balises et clients lorsque vous êtes hors ligne.

Si l’appli est lente, cela est probablement dû à une connexion Internet instable. Pour améliorer les performances dans ce cas, activez le mode **Forcer le mode hors ligne** dans les paramètres. L’appli fonctionnera alors comme si elle était hors ligne sans que vous ayez à désactiver votre connexion Internet. Une fois ce mode d

Si vous travaillez **hors connexion**, assurez-vous de synchroniser vos saisies de temps avec le cloud avant de vous déconnecter. Toute donnée non synchronisée sera perdue lors de la déconnexion.

Si vous travaillez sur le même projet tous les jours, vous pourriez peut-être définir un projet par défaut. Il vous suffira alors de taper ce sur quoi vous travaillez et de lancer le minuteur, et le projet sera sélectionné automatiquement.

Vous pouvez choisir entre :

* Un projet fixe, qui sera toujours utilisé lorsque vous démarrez un minuteur pour une saisie sans projet (jusqu’à ce que vous changiez le projet par défaut)
* **Le dernier projet utilisé**, et le minuteur sélectionnera le projet disponible le plus récemment utilisé dans votre liste de saisie de temps.

Suivi du temps hors ligne #
---------------------------

Vous pouvez suivre le temps dans l’appli Linux de Clockify même hors ligne. Vous n'avez pas besoin d'activer spécifiquement le mode hors connexion, il se déclenche automatiquement si vous n'êtes pas connecté à Internet.

Vous pouvez créer des saisies de temps manuellement ou démarrer/arrêter le minuteur. Les saisies effectuées en mode hors connexion seront enregistrées localement sur votre ordinateur. Une fois que vous serez de nouveau en ligne, elles seront synchronisées avec votre compte Web.

Les projets, les tâches et les balises ne sont pas disponibles hors connexion. Par conséquent, si ces champs sont obligatoires, vous pourrez modifier les saisies de temps avant qu’elles ne soient synchronisées.

En mode hors ligne, vous ne pouvez consulter que les saisies de temps effectuées et non encore synchronisées pendant cette période. Les autres saisies de temps ne sont pas visibles.

Si vous utilisez l’appli en **mode hors connexion**, veillez à synchroniser vos saisies de temps avec le cloud avant de vous déconnecter, afin d’éviter la perte des données non synchronisées.

Liste des entrées de temps #
----------------------------

La liste des entrées de temps vous montre vos entrées de temps les plus récentes. La liste est organisée par jour, et chaque jour contient les entrées de temps que vous avez effectuées ce jour-là.

Chaque entrée de temps montre le projet, la description, la durée avec les balises et le statut de facturation (le cas échéant).

Le format de la durée dans l'application Mac dépend du format de la durée défini dans les paramètres de l'espace de travail Clockify sur la version web. Par exemple, si vous réglez le format de la durée sur décimal sur le web (par exemple 4.00), l'application de bureau affichera la durée du temps du traceur dans le même format.

2. Ajoutez des détails supplémentaires (p. ex. affectez-le à un projet ou modifiez la description)
3. Cliquez sur **Enregistrer** pour créer une saisie dans Clockify

L'utilisation des applications est automatiquement organisée à côté du tableau des entrées suivies automatiquement, avec un résumé du temps passé sur chaque application. Vous pouvez sélectionner ces entrées groupées et les ajouter comme entrées de temps.
Pour réduire vos options, filtrez les entrées suivies automatiquement en saisissant le nom, la description ou l'URL de l'application. Le tableau affichera les résultats pertinents, ce qui vous permettra de les sélectionner et de les fusionner en une seule saisie de temps.
Vous pouvez également trier les activités en fonction de la colonne **Inactivité** par ordre croissant ou décroissant, afin d'identifier les activités qui ont eu le plus ou le moins de temps d'inactivité.

Pour gérer plusieurs entrées, cochez la case en haut du tableau. Les actions suivantes sont disponibles :

Détecter le temps d'inactivité #
--------------------------------

Lors du suivi du temps, l'application de bureau Clockify peut détecter quand vous êtes loin de votre ordinateur afin de ne pas enregistrer accidentellement ce temps. L'application détecte quand vous êtes inactif en se basant sur les mouvements de votre souris.

Si vous avez téléchargé Clockify pour Mac depuis l'App Store, la détection de l'inactivité n'est pas disponible. Vous pouvez télécharger la version avec la détection de l'inactivité ici

Vous pouvez activer une détection plus précise (qui prend également en compte l'activité du clavier) :

1. Allez dans les Préférences système de votre Mac > Sécurité et confidentialité > onglet Confidentialité
2. Dans la section “Accessibilité”, ajoutez l'application de bureau Clockify (vous pouvez la faire g


## Chunk 16

urité et confidentialité > onglet Confidentialité
2. Dans la section “Accessibilité”, ajoutez l'application de bureau Clockify (vous pouvez la faire glisser depuis votre dossier “Applications”)
3. Redémarrez l'application

Si vous définissez l'intervalle de détection à 10 minutes, après 10 minutes d'inactivité de la souris, l'application vous demandera si vous voulez inclure ces 10 minutes (plus la durée de fonctionnement du minuteur après cela) dans votre feuille de temps.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screenshot-2024-10-23-at-14.17.06-812x1024.png)

Vous avez trois options :

* **Discard idle time**: Discards idle time, and stops the running timer from when you went idle
* **Discard idle and continue**: Discards the idle time, and starts a new timer for the same activity
* **Keep idle time**: Ignores idle time, and adds it to the currently running time entry
* **Add idle time as new time entry**: Stops the timer, and adds idle time as a new time entry

Arrêt et lancement automatiques du minuteur #
---------------------------------------------

Si vous oubliez parfois d'arrêter le minuteur lorsque vous faites une pause ou que vous avez fini de travailler, l'application Mac de bureau peut arrêter le minuteur en cours pour vous.

L'application Mac peut également lancer le minuteur pour vous lorsque vous revenez travailler plus tard, afin que vous n'aye

teur en cours pour vous.

L'application Mac peut également lancer le minuteur pour vous lorsque vous revenez travailler plus tard, afin que vous n'ayez pas à vous soucier de la gestion des minuteurs.

Dans Préférences > Minuteur, vous pouvez choisir dans quels cas Clockify doit lancer et/ou arrêter automatiquement le minuteur :

* Lorsque Mac s'endort, s'éteint, ou lorsque vous fermez le couvercle (verrouillage d'écran)
* Lorsque le Mac se réveille, se déverrouille, ou lorsque l'application démarre

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screenshot-2024-10-23-at-14.20.11-808x1024.png)

Minuteur Pomodoro #
-------------------

Avec le minuteur Pomodoro, vous pouvez configurer des notifications qui vous indiquent quand il est temps de faire une pause.

L'application de bureau Clockify vous enverra une notification lorsque vous atteindrez la fin de votre intervalle Pomodoro actuel pour vous indiquer que vous devez faire une pause.

Après la pause, vous pouvez continuer à suivre le temps consacré à la dernière tâche en cliquant sur l'icône de lecture de cette entrée, ou lancer un tout nouveau minuteur.

Vous pouvez régler uniquement le minuteur Pomodoro (quand arrêter le minuteur et vous envoyer une notification), et vous pouvez également définir des pauses.

Lorsque la pause Pomodoro est activée, et que vous atteignez la fin de votre temps Pomodoro, Clockify vous


## Chunk 18

vous pouvez également définir des pauses.

Lorsque la pause Pomodoro est activée, et que vous atteignez la fin de votre temps Pomodoro, Clockify vous le fait savoir par une notification pour arrêter le minuteur de la tâche en cours. Ensuite, un nouveau minuteur démarre, avec la description "Pause Pomodoro". Une fois la pause terminée, le minuteur s'arrête, et vous pouvez démarrer un nouveau minuteur pour la tâche de votre choix.

You can start the timer for break directly from the notification by clicking **Start break** in the notification.

Vous pouvez activer le minuteur Pomodoro et définir vos intervalles de Pomodoro et de pause préférés dans Préférences > onglet Minuteur.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/pomodoro-timer.png)
![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/pomodoro-notification.png)

Si le **Mode focus** est activé dans les paramètres système de votre Mac, assurez-vous que Clockify est ajouté à votre liste d'exceptions. Dans le cas contraire, vous ne recevrez aucune notification de Clockify.

Projet par défaut #
-------------------

Si vous travaillez sur le même projet tous les jours, définissez un projet par défaut. Ensuite, il vous suffit de taper ce sur quoi vous travaillez et de lancer le minuteur, et le projet sera sélectionné automatiquement.

Vous pouvez sélectionner :

Vous pouvez sélectionner :

* **Un projet fixe**, qui sera toujours utilisé lorsque vous démarrez un minuteur pour une entrée sans projet (jusqu'à ce que vous changiez le projet par défaut)
* Ou sélectionner **Dernier projet utilisé**, et le minuteur choisira le projet disponible le plus récemment utilisé dans votre liste d'entrées de temps

Vous pouvez activer le projet par défaut dans l'onglet Paramètres > Général de l'application.

Captures d’écran #
------------------

L'application de bureau Mac dispose d'une fonctionnalité de capture d'écran intégrée. Une fois les captures d'écran activées dans les paramètres de l'espace de travail par l'administrateur, les utilisateurs seront avertis que la capture d'écran est activée.

Raccourcis clavier #
--------------------

Lorsque vous êtes concentré sur la fenêtre Clockify, vous pouvez utiliser un raccourci clavier pour effectuer rapidement une action :

* Cmd+S – Lancer le minuteur
* Cmd+T – Arrêter le minuteur
* Cmd+N – Entrer en mode de saisie manuelle de l'heure
* Cmd + Shift + S – Gagner du temps lors de l'édition
* Cmd+D – Abandonner le minuteur

s pouvez également définir votre propre raccourci global personnalisé pour démarrer/arrêter le minuteur et masquer/afficher l'application dans Paramètres > Préférences > Général.

Support hors connexion #
------------------------

Vous pouvez suivre le temps dans Clockify sur votre Mac même hors connexion.

Vous pouvez régulièrement créer des entrées de temps manuellement ou lancer/arrêter le minuteur, et les entrées de temps nouvellement créées seront enregistrées localement sur votre ordinateur. Lorsque vous vous reconnectez, l'application synchronise automatiquement toutes les entrées de temps.

En mode hors ligne, seules les données précédemment chargées (saisies de temps, projets, tâches, étiquettes, etc.) sont visibles. Par conséquent, les projets, tâches et balises ne peuvent être sélectionnés que s’ils ont été chargés avant la déconnexion.

Il n'est pas possible de créer de nouveaux projets, tâches, balises et clients lorsque vous êtes hors ligne.

L'application stocke les données localement et se synchronise avec la version web lorsque vous êtes à nouveau en ligne. Si vous le souhaitez, vous pouvez également effectuer une synchronisation manuelle en cliquant sur l'icône d'actualisation.

Si vous travaillez **hors connexion**, assurez-vous de synchroniser vos saisies de temps avec le cloud avant de vous déconnecter. Toute donnée non synchronisée sera perdue lors de la d

1. Go to **System preferences** > **Users and Groups**
2. Ouvrez l'onglet des éléments **Se connecter**
3. Ajoutez l'application souhaitée à la liste

Détection d’inactivité #
------------------------

La fonctionnalité de détection d’inactivité de l’appli Windows est conçue pour surveiller l’activité de l’utilisateur pendant le suivi du temps. Si l’utilisateur reste inactif (sans mouvement de souris ni saisie au clavier) pendant une période définie et arrête le minuteur, une notification s’affiche, indiquant la durée de cette inactivité.

**Configurez la détection du temps d'inactivité**:

1. Cliquez sur le bouton du **minuteur Clockify**
2. Ouvrez les paramètres
3. Choisissez **Préférences**
4. Cliquez sur l’onglet **Suivi du temps**
5. Réglez le minuteur selon vos préférences
6. Cochez la case **Détection du temps d'inactivité**
7. Saisissez le nombre de minutes après lequel le temps d'inactivité sera détecté (10 minutes par défaut)

Si un minuteur est activé et que votre ordinateur reste inactif pendant plusieurs minutes (aucune activité de la souris ou du clavier), une notification apparaîtra lorsque vous reprendrez votre activité (mouvement de la souris ou saisie au clavier). Cette notification vous permettra de choisir comment gérer le temps d’inactivité :

* **Rejeter le temps d'inactivité** : Le minuteur est arrêté et le temps d'inactivité détecté est retiré de son total
* **Rejeter l'inactivité et continuer** : Le minuteur est arrêté, le temps d'inactivité détecté est retiré de son total et une nouvelle minuterie démarre immédiatement pour la même activité
* **Conserver le temps d'inactivité** : Le minuteur continue de fonctionner tel quel. Fermez l’écran ou ignorez la notification pour conserver le temps d’inactivité dans l’extension
* **Ajouter le temps d'inactivité comme nouvelle entrée de temps** : Le minuteur est arrêté et le temps d’inactivité est ajouté en tant que nouvelle saisie. Deux saisies de temps sont affichées, la deuxième étant le temps pendant lequel l’utilisateur a été inactif

Le temps d’inactivité est enregistré lorsqu’un utilisateur est inactif au-delà d’une durée définie. Par exemple, si une période de 45 minutes inclut 30 minutes d’inactivité et que le seuil est de 15 minutes, les 30 minutes sont comptabilisées comme temps d’inactivité.

# Approbation du temps et des dépenses - Clockify Aide


## Chunk 1

Cet article décrit le processus par lequel les administrateurs et les gestionnaires examinent et approuvent les entrées de temps et les dépenses soumises par les membres de l'équipe. De cette manière, le temps et le budget consacrés à un projet peuvent être estimés et alloués avec précision.

L’interface utilisateur présentée dans cette vidéo peut ne pas correspondre à la dernière version de l’appli.

Approving **tracked time** is available on Standard and higher subscription plans and can be performed by workspace Admins, Project managers or Team managers.
Approving **tracked expenses** is available on PRO and higher subscription plans and can be performed by workspace Admins, Project managers or Team managers.

*Imaginez que vous êtes chef de projet et que vous supervisez une équipe de développeurs travaillant sur un projet pour un client. Les utilisateurs travaillant sur un projet soumettent des dépenses suivies lors d'activités liées au projet, telles que des licences logicielles ou des frais de déplacement. En tant que chef de projet, vous examinez ces soumissions pour vous assurer qu'elles sont conformes aux budgets du projet et des tâches, ainsi qu'aux accords conclus avec le client. Une fois approuvées, ces entrées sont intégrées dans les rapports et les factures du projet, fournissant ainsi aux clients les informations de facturation.*

# Approuver les congés - Clockify Aide


## Chunk 1

Lorsqu'un membre demande un congé, la personne responsable de cette politique reçoit un email (soit le chef d’équipe, soit une personne spécifique pour l'ensemble de la politique).

Les congés sont une fonctionnalité payante, que vous pouvez activer en mettant à niveau votre espace de travail vers le plan Standard, Pro ou Enterprise.
Les demandes de congés peuvent être approuvées par le propriétaire/administrateur ou par un chef d'équipe pour les membres de son équipe.

Onglet Demandes #
-----------------

Les demandes de congé peuvent être approuvées dans l'onglet **Congés**  sous l'onglet **Demandes** où vous trouverez une liste de toutes les demandes en attente d'approbation.

**Filtrez** toutes les demandes par **statut** (en attente, approuvées, rejetées) et par membre de l'équipe (selon la date).

**Rejetez** une demande et écrivez une note, et la personne qui a fait la demande recevra une notification par email.
Vous pouvez également rejeter des demandes précédemment approuvées en cas d'erreur.

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcwFgJpHZ3Npofb7olVNTBIPWeQQd01gXXNQincl83rCBAZJU73am-QlhOak5nKZXw4D12N4ThNvaKDL-LKdPAITZzHpA-4stDlwtTE3CtksKLDt31AvccYrMWU8BnD961wk_r5DtyQYDuhgf1Erg8tq-rq?key=UlCe95foG5quNmmGY44_Ug)

Consulter les congés des membres de l'équipe #
----------------------------------------------

Vous pouvez voir tous les membres de l'équipe qui ont planifié des congés dans l'onglet de la frise chronologique, afin de mieux planifier et synchroniser les congés.

Vous pouvez afficher les congés pour les 30 prochains jours ou choisir une période personnalisée.

Seules les personnes qui ont des congés dans cette période apparaîtront sur la frise chronologique sous forme de blocs :

* Vert (par défaut) – demande de congé approuvée
* Orange (par défaut) – demande en at


## Chunk 3

apparaîtront sur la frise chronologique sous forme de blocs :

* Vert (par défaut) – demande de congé approuvée
* Orange (par défaut) – demande en attente d'approbation
* Gris (défaut) – vacances

Bien qu'il s'agisse des couleurs par défaut pour les politiques et les congés, vous pouvez les modifier lors de la création d'une nouvelle politique ou d'un nouveau congé, ou lors de la modification des politiques et congés existants. Ainsi, au lieu du vert par défaut, vous pouvez avoir une couleur définie dans la politique comme couleur de demande de congé approuvée, une nuance plus claire de la couleur de la politique pour les demandes en attente et une couleur définie dans les congés comme couleur indiquant les congés.

Qui peut voir quoi :

* Les admins peuvent voir les congés de tout le monde
* Les chefs d'équipe peuvent voir les congés des membres de leur équipe
* Les utilisateurs réguliers peuvent voir leurs propres congés, ainsi que ceux de leur équipe (par exemple, les utilisateurs de leur chef d'équipe). Si vous activez l'option "Les utilisateurs réguliers peuvent voir les congés des membres de leur équipe" dans les paramètres de l'espace de travail, ils pourront voir les congés de tout le monde.

# Approuver les saisies de temps de l’équipe


## Chunk 1

En tant que chef d’équipe ou chef de projet, vous avez un rôle crucial dans le suivi, la vérification et l’approbation des saisies de temps de votre équipe. Ce guide vous explique comment gérer les approbations des saisies de temps afin de garantir que le temps et la répartition de budget aux projets sont précis et bien documentés.

Qu’est-ce que l’approbation des saisies de temps ? #
----------------------------------------------------

L’approbation des saisies de temps est le processus par lequel les **administrateurs**, les **chefs de projet** ou les **chefs d’équipe** examinent et approuvent ou rejettent les saisies de temps soumises par les membres de l’équipe. L’objectif est de garantir que le temps consacré aux projets est correctement suivi, budgétisé et distribué afin d’assurer l’exactitude des rapports et de la facturation.

Les approbations des feuilles de temps sont disponibles avec l’abonnement Standard ou supérieur. Il est nécessaire d’avoir un abonnement Pro ou supérieur si vous voulez approuver les dépenses.

Rôles et autorisations #
------------------------

Dans votre espace de travail, la possibilité d’approuver les heures et les dépenses dépend de votre rôle et de vos autorisations.

* **Chefs d’équipe** (si activé) : Peuvent approuver les feuilles de temps et les dépenses des utilisateurs qu’ils gèrent.
* **Chefs de projet** (si activé) : Peuvent approuver

* **Chefs de projet** (si activé) : Peuvent approuver les feuilles de temps des membres de l’équipe travaillant sur les projets qu’ils gèrent.

Un **administrateur** peut modifier ces autorisations dans **Paramètres de l’espace de travail > Autorisations** et en configurant la section **Qui peut approuver les feuilles de temps et les dépenses soumises**.

### Résumé des rôles et des autorisations #

* **Chefs d’équipe** : Peuvent approuver les heures de leurs membres d’équipe
* **Chefs de projet** : Peuvent approuver les heures des membres de l’équipe travaillant sur leurs projets

Si un utilisateur a les deux rôles, **Chef d’équipe** et **Chef de projet**, les autorisations seront combinées, lui donnant la possibilité d’approuver les heures pour son équipe ainsi que pour les projets qu’il gère.

# Approuver les saisies et les demandes de congés des membres


## Chunk 1

En tant qu’administrateur ou propriétaire d’espace de travail, la gestion des saisies de temps et des demandes de congés est essentielle pour garantir un suivi précis du temps de travail des membres de l’équipe et la prise en compte des absences prévues. Ce guide vous explique comment approuver les saisies de temps et les demandes de congés, notamment comment modifier, rejeter et envoyer des rappels.

Concepts clés #
---------------

* **Saisies de temps** : Heures enregistrées par les membres de l’équipe pour leur travail sur divers projets ou tâches
* **Demandes de congés** : Demandes soumises par les employés pour prendre des congés, tels que des vacances ou des congés maladie
* **Processus d’approbation** : Processus par lequel vous examinez et approuvez ou rejetez les saisies de temps et les demandes de congés

Autorisations d’accès #
-----------------------

* **Les administrateurs et propriétaires de l’espace de travail** peuvent approuver, rejeter et modifier les saisies de temps et les demandes de congés pour tous les membres de l’équipe
* **Les chefs d’équipe** (si cette fonctionnalité est activée) peuvent approuver, rejeter et modifier les saisies de temps et les demandes des utilisateurs qu’ils gèrent
* **Les chefs de projet** (si cette fonctionnalité est activée) peuvent approuver ou rejeter les saisies de temps et les demandes de congés des membres de l’équipe tra


## Chunk 2

projet** (si cette fonctionnalité est activée) peuvent approuver ou rejeter les saisies de temps et les demandes de congés des membres de l’équipe travaillant sur les projets qui leur sont assignés

Configurer les autorisations d’approbation #
--------------------------------------------

Pour configurer les autorisations d’approbation pour votre espace de travail :

1. Accédez à **Paramètres de l’espace de travail > onglet Autorisations**
2. Dans la section **Qui peut approuver les feuilles de temps et les dépenses soumises**, choisissez :
   * **Administrateurs et chefs d’équipe** : Les membres de l’équipe peuvent approuver les saisies de temps pour les utilisateurs qu’ils gèrent
   * **Administrateurs et chefs de projet** : Les chefs de projet peuvent approuver les saisies de temps pour les utilisateurs affectés à leurs projets

Si un utilisateur possède à la fois les rôles d’administrateur et de responsable, le rôle d’administrateur prévaudra sur les autres rôles. Par exemple, un administrateur qui est également chef d’équipe disposera des autorisations des deux rôles.

Approuver les saisies de temps #
--------------------------------

# Approve entries & time off requests for Workspace members - Clockify Help


## Chunk 1

As a Workspace Admin or Owner, managing time entries and time off requests is crucial to make sure that team members’ time is accurately tracked, and that planned absences are accounted for. This guide will walk you through the process of approving time entries and time off requests, including how to edit, reject, and send reminders.

Key concepts #
--------------

* **Time entries**: Hours tracked by team members for their work on various projects or tasks
* **Time off requests**: Requests submitted by employees to take time off, such as vacation or sick leave
* **Approval workflow**: The process by which you review and either approve or reject time entries and time off requests

Access permissions #
--------------------

* **Workspace Admins and Owners** can approve, reject, and edit time entries and time off requests for all team members
* **Team managers** (if enabled) can approve, reject, and edit the time entries and requests for users they manage
* **Project managers** (if enabled) can approve or reject time entries and time off requests for team members working on their assigned projects

Configure approval permissions #
--------------------------------

To configure approval permissions for your workspace:

1. Navigate to **Workspace settings** > **Permissions** tab
2. In the **Who can approve submitted timesheets and expenses** section, choose:
   * **Admins & Team ma


## Chunk 2

**Workspace settings** > **Permissions** tab
2. In the **Who can approve submitted timesheets and expenses** section, choose:
   * **Admins & Team managers**: Team members can approve time entries for users they manage
   * **Admins & Project managers**: Project managers can approve time entries for users on their assigned projects

If a user has both Admin and Manager roles, the Admin role will override the other roles. For example, an Admin who is also a Team Manager will have the permissions of both roles.

Approve time entries #
----------------------

To approve or reject time entries:

1. Go to the **Approvals** page in your dashboard
2. In the **Pending tab**, you’ll see time entries waiting for approval. Each entry will show the **author**, **time**, and **status** (e.g. pending, approved, rejected)

### Review time entries #

Each time entry will include:

* **User name**: Team member who submitted time
* **Project and task**: Project or task to which the time is assigned
* **Logged time**: Number of hours worked
* **Description**: Notes or description provided by the team member

You can filter the entries by user, group, or date range to make it easier to review.

* **Reject time entry**: If there are issues with the entry (e.g. incorrect hours), click **Reject**. A prompt will ask you to leave a rejection note. The user will be notified of the rejection via email.

### Bulk approve or reject time entries #

To approve or reject multiple time entries at once:

1. **Select the checkboxes** next to the entries you wish to approve or reject
2. Click the **Approve** or **Reject** button at the top of the page to apply your action to all selected entries

### Edit pending time entries #

Admins can edit any user’s pending time entries directly. Team managers can only edit pending time entries for their team members.

To edit a pending time entry:

1. Go to the **Pending** tab on the **Approvals** page
2. Click on the **edit pen icon** next to the time entry
3. In the **Edit time entry** screen, make the necessary changes:
   * Adjust **time and date**
   * Edit the **description** or **project/task**
   * Change the **billability** status

After making the necessary changes, click **Save** to finalize the change.

* **Period**: The start and end dates of the requested time off
* **Requested time**: Number of requested days/hours

# Approve team's time entries - Clockify Help


## Chunk 1

As a Team or Project manager, you play a crucial role in ensuring that your team’s time entries are accurately tracked, reviewed, and approved. This guide will walk you through the process of managing time entry approvals, ensuring that time and budget allocations for projects are accurate and well-documented.

What is time entry approval? #
------------------------------

Approving time entries is the process where **Admins**, **Project managers**, or **Team managers** review and approve or reject time entries submitted by team members. The goal is to ensure that time spent on projects is correctly tracked, budgeted, and allocated for accurate reporting and invoicing.

Time approvals are available on Standard and higher subscription plans. The ability to approve expenses requires a Pro or higher plan.

Roles and permissions #
-----------------------

In your workspace, the ability to approve time and expenses is determined by your role and the permissions.

* **Team managers** (if enabled): Can approve time entries and expenses for users they manage.
* **Project managers** (if enabled): Can approve time entries for team members working on the projects they manage.

**Admin** can modify these permissions by navigating to the **Workspace Settings > Permissions** tab and configuring the **Who can approve submitted timesheets and expenses** section.

## Chunk 1

This article describes the process by which Admins and Managers review and approve tracked time entries and expenses submitted by team members. This way, time and budget spent on a project can be precisely estimated and allocated.

User interface displayed in this video may not correspond to the latest version of the app.

Approving **tracked time** is available on Standard and higher subscription plans and can be performed by workspace Admins, Project managers or Team managers.
Approving **tracked expenses** is available on PRO and higher subscription plans and can be performed by workspace Admins, Project managers or Team managers.

*Imagine you are a project manager overseeing a team of developers working on a project for a client. Users working on a project submit tracked expenses during project-related activities, such as software licenses or travel expenses. As the project manager, you review these submissions to make sure they align with project and task budgets and client agreements. Once approved, these entries are integrated into project reports and invoices, providing clients with the billing information.*

Depending on the permissions defined in the **Workspace settings**, submitted time & expenses can be managed from the **Approvals** page in the following way:

* Admin: approve, reject, edit
* Team manager (if enabled): approve, reject, edit
* Project manager (if

the **Approvals** page in the following way:

* Admin: approve, reject, edit
* Team manager (if enabled): approve, reject, edit
* Project manager (if enabled): approve, reject

To modify these permissions:

1. Navigate to the **Workspace** settings > **Permissions** tab
2. In the **Who can approve submitted timesheets and expenses** section choose:

     \*Team members can approve timesheets and expenses submitted by their team members
   * **Admins & project managers**
     \*Project managers can approve timesheets and expenses submitted by members assigned to the projects they manage.

     \*Admins can approve time for everyone.

If a user has Admin and any other manager role, Admin role will override every other role. If a user has both Project and Team manager roles, they will have a union of permissions that combine both of these roles.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/timesheet_rejected-1024x801.png)

If a member submitted a timesheet with entries that are wrongly submitted, you can:

* Reject the entire timesheet then edit and resubmit the entry (as Owner/Admin, or their Team manager)
* Go to the Detailed report and manually correct the mistake (only as Owner/Admin, or their Team manager)

Once you approve time, time entries are permanently locked. Even Admins can’t make any edits.

If you invoice time after approval and want to mark what’s been invoiced, you can import approved time entries into an invoice and approved time entries will automatically get an invoiced tag so you can see what’s been invoiced and filter reports by status.

If the start and end time include an overnight period, there will be a superscript number next to the end time, showing how many additional days the time entry covers.

Notifications #
---------------

* User’s manager is notified if Timesheet is submitted
* User who submitted the timesheet is notified if Timesheet is approved
* User receives an email and note if Timesheet is rejected

## Chunk 8

’re Admin and want to receive an email notification when a user submits their timesheet, you need to have a Manager role for users you manage. This means that, for certain users, you’ll be:

* Admin and Team manager
* Admin and Project manager
* Team and Project manager

## Chunk 1

When a member requests time off, the person responsible for that policy will get an email (either their team manager, or a specific person for the whole policy).

Time off is a paid feature, which you can enable by upgrading your workspace to Standard, Pro, or Enterprise plan.
Time off requests can be approved by the Owner/Admin, or by a Team Manager for their team members.

Requests tab #
--------------

Time off requests can be approved on the **Time off** under the **Requests** tab where you’ll find a list of all requests awaiting your approval.

**Filter** all requests by **status** (pending, approved, rejected), and by a specific team member (according to date).

**Reject** a request and write a note, and the person who made the request will receive an email notification.
You can also reject previously approved requests in case there was an error.

You can see all team members who have scheduled leaves in the Timeline tab, so you can plan and synchronize leaves better.

You can see leaves for the next 30 days, or choose a custom time range.

Only people who have time off in that period will show up on the timeline as blocks:

* Green (default) – approved time off request
* Orange (default) – pending request that’s waiting approval
* Gray (default) – holiday

Although these are the default colors for policy and holiday, you can change them when creating a new policy or holiday, or when editing the existing ones.

# Aprobar entradas de tiempo del equipo - Ayuda de Clockify


## Chunk 1

Como gerente de equipo o de proyecto, desempeñas un papel crucial para garantizar que las entradas de tiempo de tu equipo se registren, revisen y aprueben con precisión. Esta guía te guiará en el proceso de gestión de las aprobaciones de entradas de tiempo, garantizando que las asignaciones de tiempo y presupuesto para los proyectos sean precisas y estén bien documentadas.

¿Qué es la aprobación de entradas de tiempo? #
----------------------------------------------

Aprobación de las entradas de tiempo es el proceso mediante el cual los **administradores**, **gerentes de proyecto** o **gerentes de equipo** revisan, aprueban o rechazan las entradas de tiempo enviadas por los miembros del equipo. El objetivo es garantizar que el tiempo dedicado a los proyectos se registre, presupueste y asigne correctamente para generar informes y facturas precisos.

Las aprobaciones de tiempo están disponibles en los planes de suscripción Standard y superiores. Para poder aprobar gastos se requiere un plan Pro o superior.

Roles y permisos #
------------------

En tu espacio de trabajo, la capacidad para aprobar tiempo y gastos depende de tu rol y los permisos.

* **Gerentes de equipo** (si está habilitado): Pueden aprobar entradas de tiempo y gastos para los usuarios que gestionan
* **Gerentes de proyecto** (si está habilitado): Pueden aprobar las entradas de tiempo de los miembros del equipo

# Aprobar entradas y solicitudes de tiempo libre para miembros del espacio de trabajo - Ayuda de Clockify


## Chunk 1

Como administrador o propietario de espacio de trabajo, gestionar las entradas de tiempo y las solicitudes de tiempo libre es esencial para garantizar que el tiempo de los miembros del equipo se registre correctamente, y que las ausencias planificadas sean tomadas en cuenta.

Conceptos clave #
-----------------

* **Entradas de tiempo**: Las horas registradas por los miembros del equipo para su trabajo en varios proyectos o tareas
* **Solicitudes de tiempo libre**: Las solicitudes enviadas por los empleados para tomarse tiempo libre, como las vacaciones o baja por enfermedad
* **Proceso de aprobación**: El proceso de revisar y aprobar/rechazar las entradas de tiempo y solicitudes de tiempo libre

Permisos de acceso #
--------------------

* **Los administradores y propietarios del espacio de trabajo** pueden aprobar, rechazar y editar las entradas de tiempo y las solicitudes de tiempo libre de todos los miembros del equipo
* **Los gerentes de equipo** (si está activado) pueden aprobar, rechazar y editar las entradas de tiempo de los usuarios que gestionan
* **Los gerentes de proyecto** (si está activado) pueden aprobar o rechazar las entradas de tiempo y las solicitudes de tiempo libre de los miembros del equipo trabajando en sus proyectos asignados

## Chunk 1

Cuando el miembro solicite el tiempo libre, la persona responsable para esa política recibirá un correo electrónico (ya sea su gerente de equipo, o una persona específica para toda la política).

El tiempo libre es una función de pago que puedes habilitar si actualizas tu espacio de trabajo al plan Standard, Pro o Enterprise.

Las solicitudes de tiempo libre pueden ser aprobadas por el propietario o administrador, o por un gerente de equipo para los miembros de su equipo.

Pestaña de Solicitudes #
------------------------

Las solicitudes de tiempo libre se pueden aprobar en **Bajas** en la pestaña **Solicitudes,** donde encontrarás una lista de todas las solicitudes que esperan tu aprobación.

**Filtra** todas las solicitudes por **estado** (pendiente, aprobado, rechazado) y por un miembro específico del equipo (según fecha).

**Rechaza** una solicitud y escribe una nota; la persona que realizó la solicitud recibirá una notificación por correo electrónico.
También puedes rechazar solicitudes aprobadas previamente en caso de que haya un error.

* Rechazar toda la planilla de horarios y luego editar y volver a enviar la entrada (como propietario/administrador o su gerente de equipo)
* Ir al  Informe detallado y corregir manualmente el error (solo como Propietario/Administrador, o su Gerente de Equipo)

Una vez que apruebes el tiempo, las entradas de tiempo se bloquean permanentemente. Ni siquiera los administradores pueden realizar modificaciones.

Si facturas el tiempo después de la aprobación y quieres marcar lo que se ha facturado, puedes importar las entradas de tiempo aprobado a una factura y las entradas de tiempo aprobado obtendrán automáticamente una etiqueta de facturado para que puedas ver lo que se ha facturado y filtrar los informes por estado.

Si la hora de inicio y fin incluye un período nocturno, habrá un número superíndice al lado de la hora de fin, que mostrará cuántos días adicionales cubre la entrada de tiempo.

# Aprovar entradas e solicitações de folga Clockify


## Chunk 1

Como administrador ou proprietário de um espaço de trabalho, gerenciar entradas de horas e solicitações de folga é crucial para garantir que o tempo dos integrantes da equipe seja monitorado com precisão e que as ausências planejadas sejam contabilizadas. Este guia orientará você no processo de aprovação de entradas de tempo e solicitações de folga, incluindo como editar, rejeitar e enviar lembretes.

Conceitos principais #
----------------------

* **Entradas de tempo**: horas registradas pelos integrantes da equipe em seus trabalhos em vários projetos ou tarefas.
* **Solicitações de folga**: solicitações enviadas por funcionários para tirar folga, como férias ou licença médica.
* **Fluxo de aprovação**: o processo pelo qual você analisa e aprova ou rejeita registros de tempo e solicitações de folga.

Permissões de acesso #
----------------------

* **Administradores e proprietários do espaço de trabalho** podem aprovar, rejeitar e editar as entradas de tempo e solicitações de folga para todos os integrantes da equipe
* **Gerentes de equipe** (se habilitados) podem aprovar, rejeitar e editar entradas de tempo e solicitações de folga para os usuários que gerenciam
* **Gerentes de projeto** (se habilitados) podem aprovar ou rejeitar entradas de tempo e solicitações de folga para os integrantes da equipe que trabalham em seus projetos atribuídos

## Chunk 1

Quando o integrante solicitar a folga, o responsável por aquela política receberá um e-mail (seja o gerente da equipe ou uma pessoa específica para toda a política).

A folga é uma ferramenta paga, que você pode habilitar atualizando seu espaço de trabalho para o plano Standard, Pro ou Enterprise.
As solicitações de folga podem ser aprovadas pelo Proprietário/Administrador ou por um Gerente de Equipe para os membros de sua equipe.

Aba de solicitações #
---------------------

Os pedidos de folga podem ser aprovados em **Folga** na aba **Solicitações**, onde você encontrará uma lista de todos os pedidos aguardando sua aprovação.

**Filtre** todas as solicitações por **status** (pendente, aprovada, rejeitada) e por membro específico da equipe (de acordo com a data).

**Rejeite** uma solicitação e escreva uma nota, e a pessoa que fez a solicitação receberá uma notificação por e-mail.
Você também pode rejeitar solicitações aprovadas anteriormente caso tenha ocorrido um erro.

Somente as pessoas que tiverem folga nesse período aparecerão no cronograma como blocos:

* Verde (padrão) – solicitação de folga aprovada
* Laranja (padrão) – solicitação pendente que aguarda aprovação
* Cinza (padrão) – feriado

Embora essas sejam as cores padrão para política e feriado, você pode alterá-las


## Chunk 3

licitação pendente que aguarda aprovação
* Cinza (padrão) – feriado

Embora essas sejam as cores padrão para política e feriado, você pode alterá-las ao criar uma nova política ou feriado, ou ao editar as existentes. Dessa forma, em vez do verde padrão, você pode ter uma cor definida na política como uma cor de solicitação de folga aprovada, um tom mais claro da cor da política para solicitação pendente e uma cor definida no feriado como a cor que indica feriado.

Quem pode ver o quê:

* Os administradores podem ver as folgas de todos
* Os gerentes de equipe podem ver as folgas dos integrantes de sua equipe
* Os usuários regulares podem ver os seus próprios, além das folgas de sua equipe (por exemplo, os usuários do gerente de equipe). Se você ativar Usuários regulares podem ver as folgas fora de suas equipes nas configurações do espaço de trabalho, eles poderão ver as folgas de todos.

# Aprovar os lançamentos de tempo da equipe Clockify


## Chunk 1

Como gerente de equipe ou projeto, você desempenha um papel crucial para garantir que os registros de horas da sua equipe sejam rastreados, revisados e aprovados com precisão. Este guia o guiará pelo processo de gerenciamento das aprovações de registros de horas, garantindo que as alocações de tempo e orçamento para projetos sejam precisas e bem documentadas.

O que é aprovação de entrada de ponto? #
----------------------------------------

A aprovação de registros de horas é o processo em que **administradores, gerentes de projeto ou gerentes de equipe** revisam e aprovam, ou rejeitam os registros de horas enviados pelos membros da equipe. O objetivo é garantir que o tempo gasto em projetos seja corretamente rastreado, orçado e alocado para relatórios e faturamento precisos.

Aprovações de tempo estão disponíveis nos planos de assinatura Standard e superiores. A aprovação de despesas requer um plano Pro ou superior.

Funções e permissões #
----------------------

No seu espaço de trabalho, a capacidade de aprovar tempo e despesas é determinada pela sua função e pelas permissões.

* **Team managers** (if enabled): Can approve time entries and expenses for users they manage.
* **Project managers** (if enabled): Can approve time entries for team members working on the projects they manage.

O administrador pode modificar essas permissões navegando até Configurações do espaço de

# Aprovar tempo e despesas Clockify


## Chunk 1

Este artigo descreve o processo pelo qual administradores e gerentes revisam e aprovam entradas de tempo e despesas controladas enviadas por integrantes da equipe. Dessa forma, o tempo e o orçamento gastos em um projeto podem ser estimados e alocados com precisão.

A interface do usuário exibida neste vídeo pode não corresponder à versão mais recente do aplicativo.

Approving **tracked time** is available on Standard and higher subscription plans and can be performed by workspace Admins, Project managers or Team managers.
Approving **tracked expenses** is available on PRO and higher subscription plans and can be performed by workspace Admins, Project managers or Team managers.

*Imagine que você é um gerente de projeto supervisionando uma equipe de desenvolvedores trabalhando em um projeto para um cliente. Os usuários que trabalham em um projeto enviam despesas monitoradas durante atividades relacionadas ao projeto, como licenças de software ou despesas de viagem. Como gerente de projeto, você analisa esses envios para garantir que estejam alinhados com os orçamentos do projeto e das tarefas e com os contratos do cliente. Depois de aprovados, esses lançamentos são integrados aos relatórios e faturas do projeto, fornecendo aos clientes as informações de faturamento.*

Dependendo das permissões definidas nas **configurações do espaço de trabalho**, o tempo e as despesas enviados


## Chunk 2

ntes as informações de faturamento.*

Dependendo das permissões definidas nas **configurações do espaço de trabalho**, o tempo e as despesas enviados podem ser gerenciados na página **Aprovações** da seguinte maneira:

* Administrador: aprovar, rejeitar, editar
* Gerente de equipe (se habilitado): aprovar, rejeitar, editar
* Gerente de projeto (se habilitado): aprovar, rejeitar

Para modificar essas permissões:

1. Navegue até as **Configurações do espaço de trabalho** > **Permissões** guia
2. Na seção **Quem pode aprovar planilhas de horas e despesas enviadas**, escolha:
   ![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screenshot-2024-07-22-at-12.35.36.png)

Se um usuário tiver função de administrador e qualquer outra função de gerente, a função de administrador substituirá todas as outras funções. Se um usuário tiver funções de gerente de projeto e de equipe, ele terá uma união de permissões que combinam essas duas funções.

# Arbeitsbereich einrichten - Clockify-Hilfe


## Chunk 1

Als Besitzer oder Administrator eines Arbeitsbereichs kannst du dessen Gesamteinstellungen konfigurieren und verwalten.
In diesem Leitfaden führen wir dich durch die wesentlichen Schritte zur Konfiguration deines Arbeitsbereichs, zur Verwaltung von Benutzern und zur Anpassung der Einstellungen, um den Anforderungen deines Teams gerecht zu werden.

Was ist ein Arbeitsbereich? #
-----------------------------

Ein Arbeitsbereich ist eine Sammlung von Personen und Projekten in Clockify. Wenn du dich zum ersten Mal bei Clockify registrierst, erhältst du automatisch einen Clockify-Arbeitsbereich und dein CAKE.com-Konto mit einer Organisation darin.
Du kannst auch einem Clockify-Arbeitsbereich in einer bestehenden CAKE.com-Organisation beitreten. Ein Arbeitsbereich enthält alle Zeiteinträge, Projekte, Personen und Einstellungen.

### Sichtbarkeit #

Nur Personen, die Teil des Arbeitsbereichs sind, können dessen Daten anzeigen und mit ihnen interagieren. Du kannst gleichzeitig Mitglied in mehreren Arbeitsbereichen sein und einfach zwischen ihnen wechseln.

### Mehrere Arbeitsbereiche  #

eils einer eigenen Gruppe von Benutzern, Projekten und Zeiteinträgen.

Mehrere Arbeitsbereiche sind nützlich, wenn du ein separates Konto für jede Unterfirma oder Abteilung haben möchtest. Das ist ideal, wenn du die Zeiterfassung und Projekte über verschiedene Teams hinweg trennen musst.

*Wenn du z. B. zwei Firmen oder Abteilungen hast, kannst du zwei Arbeitsbereiche einrichten und verschiedene Personen in jeden einladen. Dann kannst du je nach Bedarf zwischen ihnen wechseln.
Oder du kannst als Teammitglied in einem Arbeitsbereich die Zeit für das Unternehmen erfassen, für das du arbeitest, und zusätzlich einen persönlichen Arbeitsbereich haben, in dem du deine persönlichen Daten verwalten kannst und Administrator bist.*

---------------------------------------------------

Im Arbeitsbereich, aus dem du Daten verschieben möchtest, gehe zum Detaillierten Bericht und exportiere die Daten in eine CSV-Datei.

* Diese Datei enthält Zeiteinträge, Projekte, Aufgaben, Kunden und mehr
* Bevor du exportierst, stelle sicher, dass du den korrekten Datumsbereich über den Kalender auswählst:

1. Gehe zum **Detaillierten Bericht**
2. Wähle einen Datumsbereich aus dem Kalender
3. Wende Filter an (optional)
4. Exportiere die Daten als CSV

# Arbeitsfreie Tage verwalten - Clockify-Hilfe


## Chunk 1

Du kannst Urlaubstage und Richtlinien zur arbeitsfreien Zeit auf der Seite **Arbeitsfreie Zeit** definieren und verwalten.

Die arbeitsfreie Zeit ist eine kostenpflichtige Funktion, die du aktivieren kannst, indem du deinen Arbeitsbereich auf den Standard-, Pro- oder Enterprise-Abonnementplan aktualisierst.

Um deine arbeitsfreien Tage zu verwalten, solltest du:

1. Navigiere zur Seite **Arbeitsfreie Zeit**
2. Auf das Symbol **Einstellungen** klicken
3. Arbeitstage in den **Arbeitsbereichseinstellungen** definieren (Samstag und Sonntag werden standardmäßig als arbeitsfreie Tage markiert)

Feiertage verwalten #
---------------------

Du kannst Feiertage verwalten, indem du mehrere Feiertage erstellst, verschiedenen Mitarbeitern unterschiedliche Feiertagen hinzufügst (z. B. wenn manche Mitarbeiter für einen bestimmten Feiertag nicht frei bekommen), für einen Feiertag festlegen, ob er jährlich angezeigt wird. Du kannst verschiedene Farben für Feiertage definieren, indem du eine auswählst oder eine benutzerdefinierte Farbe für jeden Feiertag erstellst.

Beantragen Mitarbeiter Urlaub, werden Feiertage und Wochenenden nicht gezählt.

*Ein Beispiel: Wenn ein Mitarbeiter eine arbeitsfreie Zeit vom 1. bis zum 7. Januar anfordert - dabei ist der 1. Januar ein Feiertag, der 2. Januar ist Samstag und der 3. Januar ist Sonntag - ist die gesamte Anzahl der arbeitsfreien Tage 4.*

Erstellte Feiertage werden in absteigender chronologischer Reihenfolge angezeigt.
Die jährlichen Feiertage ohne ein bestimmtes Jahr werden nach Datum sortiert, entweder für das aktuelle Jahr oder für das nächste, je nach dem heutigen Datum.

Um Feiertage zu bearbeiten oder zu löschen, solltest du:

1. Gehe zur Seite **Arbeitsfreie Zeit**
2. Klicke auf die Schaltfläche **Einstellungen** oben rechts auf der Seite
3. Wähle **Feiertage verwalten**
4. Klicke auf die **drei Punkte** > **Bearbeiten** neben dem Feiertag im Bildschirm **Feiertage**

Du kannst den Namen des Feiertages bearbeiten sowie zugewiesene Personen, Zeitraum, Farbe und ob er jährlich erfolgt.

Wenn Arbeitstage geändert oder gelöscht werden, hat das keinen Effekt auf die vorhandenen Anforderungen von arbeitsfreier Zeit.

Richtlinien verwalten #
-----------------------

Die Richtlinien zur arbeitsfreien Zeit können auf gleiche Weise wie Feiertage verwaltet werden.

Du kannst:

* mehrere Richtlinien erstellen.
* verschiedenen Richtlinien verschiedene Mitarbeiter zuweisen (wenn eine Richtlinie z. B. für bestimmte Mitarbeiter nicht gilt).
* überprüfen, ob die Richtlinie Genehmigung erfordert und von einem Admin oder Manager oder einem anderen bestimmten Mitglied genehmigt werden soll.

# Arbeitszeittabelle - Clockify-Hilfe


## Chunk 1

Zusätzlich zu Nutzung des Timers kannst du Zeiten in der Arbeitstabelle-Ansicht hinzufügen und überprüfen.

Für eine umfassende Anleitung zu Clockify-Arbeitszeittabellen sieh dir das Video an und folge den Anweisungen unten.

Die in diesem Video angezeigte Benutzeroberfläche entspricht möglicherweise nicht der aktuellen Version der App.

Um eine Arbeitszeittabelle zu aktivieren, solltest du:

1. Zur Arbeitsbereichseinstellungen gehen
2. In der Registerkarte **Allgemein**, zum Abschnitt **Arbeitszeittabelle** > **Arbeitszeittabelle aktivieren** gehen
3. Umschalter einschalten, um die Arbeitszeittabelle zu aktivieren

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-20-at-11.39.52-1024x499.png)

Die Arbeitszeittabellen-Ansicht ist eine viel schnellere Methode zum Eingeben von Zeiten und eignet sich perfekt für Mitarbeiter, die daran gewöhnt sind, ihre Arbeitszeittabellen am Ende des Tages manuell auszufüllen und viele Zeiten auf einmal eingeben müssen.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-20-at-11.49.18-1024x485.png)

Du solltest einfach die Projekte/Aufgaben auswählen, an denen du während der Woche gearbeitet hast, und die Zeit für jeden Tag ausfüllen.

1. Ein Projekt/eine Aufgabe auswählen, an dem/der du gearbeitet hast
2. Dann aufschreiben, wie viel du an diesem Tag an dieser Aufgabe gearbeitet hast
3. Eine Zeile für jedes zusätzliche Projekt/jede zusätzliche Aufgabe hinzufügen, an dem/der du gearbeitet hast
4. Zu einer anderen Woche mithilfe der Datumsnavigation in der oberen rechten Ecke wechseln
5. Um weitere Details hinzuzufügen (Beschreibung, Tag, Start-/Endzeit, abrechenbarer Status), sollst du den Mauszeiger über eine Zelle mit Zeit bewegen und auf die **drei Punkte** klicken

Wenn du 1 eingibst, wird daraus 1 Minute. Wenn du jedoch zum Dezimalformat wechselst, wird 1 zu 1h.

Wenn die Anfangs- und die Endzeit einen Zeitraum von einer Nacht umfasst, erscheint neben der Endzeit eine hochgestellte Zahl, die angibt, wie viele zusätzliche Tage der Zeiteintrag umfasst.

Timer und Arbeitszeittabelle teilen sich deine Zeitdaten. Wenn du also Zeit über den Timer hinzufügst, siehst du diese Zeit auch in der Arbeitszeittabelle und umgekehrt.

Alle Benutzer können ihre Zeiten bearbeiten oder löschen, solange sie nicht gesperrt sind. Du kannst auch Zeiten löschen, indem du auf das X klickst. Wenn du einen Zeiteintrag in der Arbeitszeittabelle löschst, werden alle mit dieser Aufgabe verbundenen Zeiten für diese Woche gelöscht, also sei vorsichtig.

## Chunk 3

le mit dieser Aufgabe verbundenen Zeiten für diese Woche gelöscht, also sei vorsichtig.

Die über die Arbeitszeittabelle erfasste Zeit übernimmt den Verrechenbarkeitsstatus des Projekts. Wenn du diesen Status ändern möchtest, nutze den Timer oder fahre mit der Maus über die Zelle mit der Zeit, klicke auf die **drei Punkte** und nimm die Änderung vor.

Sobald die Arbeitszeittabelle-Ansicht aktiviert ist, wird Projekt automatisch zu einem Pflichtfeld und kann nicht deaktiviert werden (das bedeutet, dass alle Zeiteinträge ein Projekt zugewiesen bekommen müssen, bevor sie hinzugefügt werden können).

Der erste Eintrag, den du für den Tag erstellst, übernimmt seine Startzeit von deinem **Tagesbeginn (Zeiteinstellungen)** in den Profileinstellungen. Jeder nachfolgende Eintrag für diesen Tag wird automatisch hochgezählt, basierend auf der Reihenfolge, in der du die Zeit eingibst.

Neue Arbeitszeittabellen schnell erstellen #
--------------------------------------------

Wenn eine neue Woche beginnt, erhältst du eine leere Arbeitszeittabelle für diese Woche. Du kannst deine leere Arbeitszeittabelle schnell mit Aufgaben füllen, indem du eine der Optionen verwendest:

Wenn du täglich an denselben Aufgaben arbeitest, kannst du die Projekte und Aufgaben aus der letzten Arbeitszeittabelle ohne die erfasste Zeit übernehmen.
Wähle, ob du **nur die Aktivitäten kopieren** oder **Aktivitäten und

Du kannst eine Arbeitszeittabelle mit Projekten/Aufgaben aus einer beliebigen Woche als Vorlage speichern. Wenn deine Arbeitszeittabelle leer ist, solltest du unten auf die gewünschte Vorlage klicken, und deine Arbeitszeittabelle wird mit allen Projekten/Aufgaben aus der Vorlage ausgefüllt.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/timesheet_this_week-1024x560.png)

Du hast die Flexibilität, eine oder mehrere Vorlagen auf deine Arbeitszeittabelle anzuwenden. Beachte bitte, dass Arbeitszeittabellen-Vorlagen nur für den Benutzer verfügbar sind, der sie erstellt hat.

Die Optionen **Letzte Woche kopieren** und **Vorlagen** sind nur verfügbar, wenn du deine Arbeitszeittabelle leer und der Genehmigungszeitraum auf **Wöchentlich** eingestellt ist. Wenn dieser angewendet ist, wechselt der Status des Eintrags zu **Angewendet**.

# Arbeitszeittabellen sperren - Clockify-Hilfe


## Chunk 1

Du kannst Mitarbeiter daran hindern, ihre alten Zeiteinträge zu bearbeiten oder neue Zeiteinträge zu einem vergangenen Datum hinzuzufügen, indem du Arbeitszeittabellen sperrst. Sobald du Arbeitszeittabellen gesperrt hast, kannst du deine Berichte an deine Kunden oder Buchhalter sicher senden.

Das Sperren von Arbeitszeittabellen ist eine der kostenpflichtigen Funktionen, die du aktivierst, indem du deinen Arbeitsbereich auf den Standard-, Pro-, oder Enterprise- Abonnementplan aktualisierst.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/lock.png)

Schritte zum Sperren von Arbeitszeittabellen #
----------------------------------------------

1. Zum Arbeitsbereichsnamen navigieren
2. Das Menü öffnen
3. **Arbeitsbereichseinstellungen** aus dem Dropdown-Menü wählen
4. Zur Registerkarte **Berechtigungen** wechseln
5. Schalter **"Einträge sperren"** umschalten, um die Option zu aktivieren
6. Ein Datum festlegen, bevor alle Zeiteinträge gesperrt werden sollen
7. Änderungen werden nach der Auswahl des Datums oder dem Umschalten des Schalters **"Einträge sperren"** automatisch gespeichert

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-07-at-12.44.06-300x87.png)

Sind die Einträge beispielsweise vor dem 15. April gesperrt, können reguläre Benutzer:

* Zeiteinträge mit dem Datum 14. April oder früher nicht bearbeiten
* neue Zeiteinträge mit dem Datum


## Chunk 2

m 15. April gesperrt, können reguläre Benutzer:

* Zeiteinträge mit dem Datum 14. April oder früher nicht bearbeiten
* neue Zeiteinträge mit dem Datum 14. April oder früher nicht hinzufügen

Das Sperren von Arbeitszeittabellen betrifft nicht Administratoren. Die Administratoren können Arbeitszeiten während des gesperrten Zeitraums weiterhin bearbeiten und hinzufügen.

Um die Arbeitszeittabellen zu entsperren, solltest du den Schalter ausschalten, und alle Mitarbeiter können ihre Zeiteinträge bearbeiten und neue zu jedem beliebigen Datum hinzufügen.

Wenn du Arbeitszeittabellen jeden Monat sperrst und Benutzer über Zeitzonen hinweg hast, solltest du die Sperre am 2. des Monats aktivieren. Falls du sie am 1. des Monats aktivierst, kann dein Team aus einer späteren Zeitzone Daten für den letzten Tag des Vormonats wegen der Zeitzonendifferenz nicht eingeben.

Automatische Sperre #
---------------------

Du kannst die automatische Sperre aktivieren und das Sperrdatum wird jeden Tag, jede Woche oder jeden Monat automatisch aktualisiert, sodass du es nicht mehr manuell tun musst.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-07-at-12.42.42-1024x172.png)

3. **"Sperrdatum automatisch aktualisieren"** aktivieren
4. Sperrhäufigkeit auswählen (wöchentlich, monatlich, früher als x Tage/Wochen/Monate)

Wenn du die Option **Wöchentlich** auswählst, solltest du zwei Tage auswählen: wann wird das Sperrdatum aktualisiert (z. B. Mittwoch) und wann ist der erste Wochentag in deinem Unternehmen (z. B. Montag). Auf diese Weise kann dein Team am Anfang der Woche (am Montag) noch immer ihre fehlenden Stunden für die vorige Woche hinzufügen, bevor die Woche gesperrt wird (dies passiert am Mittwoch).

Sobald die automatische Sperre aktiviert wurde, kannst du ein Sperrdatum nicht manuell erstellen.

Wenn du ein **Sperrdatum erstellst, das automatisch aktiviert wird und älter als 1 Tag ist**, wird die Sperre am Ende des Tages automatisch aktiviert, damit Benutzer ihre gestrigen Stunden nicht bearbeiten können.

Die Tagessperre wird jeden Tag um Mitternacht nach der Zeitzone des Arbeitsbereichsbesitzers aktualisiert.

Wenn du Arbeitszeittabellen jeden Monat sperrst und Benutzer über Zeitzonen hinweg hast, solltest du die Sperre am 2. des Monats aktivieren - sonst kann dein Team aus einer späteren Zeitzone Daten für den letzten Tag jedes Monats nicht eingeben.

# Arredondamento de tempo no Clockify


## Chunk 1

Arredonde as horas e minutos das entradas de tempo para cima ou para baixo para que seus relatórios sejam agradáveis e organizados, sem detalhes confusos ou desnecessários.

Por exemplo, você pode arredondar no relatório para o minuto inteiro mais próximo para não se distrair com segundos ao olhar para um relatório. Ou você pode arredondar o tempo para os 6 minutos mais próximos e exportá-los para obter todas as entradas de tempo exibidas com um número redondo com apenas um decimal.

O arredondamento de tempo é uma ferramenta paga, que você pode habilitar atualizando seu espaço de trabalho para o plano pago Standard, Pro ou Enterprise.

Arredondamento de tempo #
-------------------------

Para arredondar as entradas de tempo, vá para qualquer relatório e ative o botão Arredondamento.

Para escolher uma opção de arredondamento diferente, clique no menu suspenso ao lado de Arredondamento e escolha Configurações.

## Chunk 2

--------------------------------------------------

O arredondamento de tempo afeta apenas os relatórios e pode ser ativado e desativado conforme você desejar.

* **Calculando a duração**: o Clockify primeiro arredonda a duração de cada entrada de tempo e, em seguida, os adiciona.
* **Exportação**: as durações e valores serão arredondados na exportação também.
* **Valores calculados**: ao calcular o valor de suas horas faturáveis, o Clockify faz entradas de tempo arredondadas.
* **Relatório detalhado**: você não pode editar as entradas de tempo no relatório detalhado quando o arredondamento estiver ativado.

O arredondamento de tempo não altera nenhum dado, apenas como ele é exibido (visualizado), e sempre pode ser ativado/desativado. Se você definir o arredondamento para o minuto mais próximo, sua entrada de hora 00:10:56 será exibida como 00:11:00 assim que você ativar o arredondamento. E voltará para 00:10:56 quando você desligar o arredondamento.

Opções de arredondamento #
--------------------------

Você pode definir o intervalo de arredondamento e como deseja arredondar as entradas de tempo nas configurações do seu espaço de trabalho:

* **Arredondar para baixo** (por exemplo: se o intervalo for definido como 30 minutos, uma entrada de 1 a 29min aparecerá nos relatórios como 0min)
* **Arredondar** (por exemplo: se o intervalo for definido para 30 minutos,

* **Arredondar para o mais próximo** (por exemplo: se o intervalo for definido como 30 minutos, uma entrada de 1 a 14 minutos aparecerá nos relatórios como 0 minutos e uma entrada de 16 a 29 minutos como 30 minutos)

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/rounding.png)

Se o formato de duração estiver definido como hh:mm nas configurações do Espaço de trabalho, a entrada de tempo será arredondada para um minuto. Por exemplo, se você rastreou 0 horas, 1 minuto e 15 segundos (00:01:15), a entrada será exibida como 0 horas e 2 minutos (00:02). Isso não faz parte do recurso de arredondamento de tempo e você pode alterar o formato de duração nas configurações sem qualquer plano, incluindo o plano gratuito.

# Arrondi du temps - Clockify centre d'aide


## Chunk 1

Arrondissez les saisies de temps à la minute ou à l'heure la plus proche pour que vos rapports soient clairs et précis, sans tous les détails inutiles.

Par exemple, vous pouvez arrondir le temps à la minute entière la plus proche dans les rapports afin de ne pas être distrait par les secondes lorsque vous consultez un rapport. Vous pouvez aussi arrondir le temps aux 6 minutes les plus proches et les exporter pour que toutes les entrées de temps s'affichent sous la forme d'un chiffre rond avec une seule décimale.

L'arrondi des temps est une fonctionnalité payante, que vous pouvez activer en mettant à niveau votre espace de travail vers un plan payant Standard, Pro ou Enterprise.

Activer l'arrondi #
-------------------

Pour arrondir les saisies de temps, allez dans n'importe quel rapport et activez le bouton d'arrondi.

Pour choisir une autre option d'arrondi, cliquez sur la liste déroulante à côté de “Arrondissement” et choisissez “Paramètres”.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-21-at-13.22.38-1024x446.png)

* **Exportation**: les durées et les valeurs seront également arrondies dans l'exportation.
* **Revenus calculés**: lors du calcul de la valeur de vos heures facturables, Clockify prend les saisies de temps arrondies.
* **Rapport détaillé**: vous ne pouvez pas modifier les saisies de temps dans le rapport détaillé lorsque l'arrondi est activé.

L'arrondissement du temps ne modifie pas les données, mais seulement leur affichage, qui peut toujours être activé ou désactivé. Si vous avez réglé l'arrondissement à la minute la plus proche, votre entrée de temps 00:10:56 sera affichée comme 00:11:00 une fois que vous aurez activé l'arrondi. Et elle redeviendra 00:10:56 lorsque vous désactiverez l'arrondissement.

Options d'arrondissement #
--------------------------

Vous pouvez définir l'intervalle d'arrondissement et la manière dont vous souhaitez arrondir les saisies de temps dans les paramètres de votre espace de travail :

* **Arrondir à la valeur inférieure** (par exemple, si l'intervalle est fixé à 30 minutes, une entrée de 1

* **Arrondir à la valeur la plus proche** (par exemple : si l'intervalle est fixé à 30 minutes, une entrée de 1 à 14 minutes apparaîtra dans les rapports comme 0 minute, et une entrée de 16 à 29 minutes comme 30 minutes)

# Asignar moneda al cliente en Clockify


## Chunk 1

En caso de que estés trabajando en proyectos para clientes que usan varias monedas, en lugar de usar una moneda en un nivel de espacio de trabajo para todos tus proyectos, puedes asignar diferentes monedas a diferentes clientes.

Por ejemplo: *El cliente A utiliza dólares estadounidenses como moneda y el cliente B euros. Puedes registrar los gastos relacionados con el proyecto en dólares estadounidenses para el Cliente A y en euros para el Cliente B.*

La moneda asignada a nivel de espacio de trabajo se asigna de forma predeterminada a todos los clientes disponibles en el espacio de trabajo. Para asignar moneda a un cliente, debes ser administrador y tu espacio de trabajo debe tener un plan de suscripción **PRO** o superior.

Asignar moneda #
----------------

Para asignar moneda al cliente:

1. Ve a la página de **Clientes** en tu espacio de trabajo
2. En la lista de **Clientes,** encuentraelcliente que quieres editar
3. Haz clic en el botón **Editar**  junto a su nombre
4. Elige la moneda de la barra de búsqueda que aparece con todas las monedas disponibles en el espacio de trabajo

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-06-at-16.27.18-10-658x1024.png)

Moneda del cliente en Clockify #
--------------------------------

#### Prueba #

* Después de una degradación o del final de un período de prueba, todas las monedas vuelven a la moneda predeterminada
* La suscripción restaura la configuración de moneda que estaba vigente antes del período de prueba

La moneda está presente en todas las acciones relacionadas con el cliente, desde la creación o edición del cliente, hasta la descripción general del monto en el panel, el estado del proyecto, etc. Si se asigna una moneda distinta a la predeterminada a un cliente, afecta la **adición de entradas de tiempo** en toda la aplicación y **Clientes**, **Gastos**, **Informes**, **Proyectos** y **Facturas**.

#### Clientes #

De forma predeterminada, cada cliente predeterminado obtiene una moneda de espacio de trabajo predeterminada.

Siempre que cambie la moneda relacionada con el cliente, se presentarán los valores de moneda actualizados y la nueva se marcará como actualizada.

#### Añadir entradas de tiempo en el rastreador de tiempo, planilla de horarios, calendario, informe detallado #

Las cantidades facturables y de costes de la entrada se calculan en la **moneda predeterminada** si:

* la entrada no tiene un proyecto
* el proyecto de entrada no tiene cliente

Los montos facturables y de costos de la entrada se calculan en la **moneda del cl


## Chunk 3

ada no tiene un proyecto
* el proyecto de entrada no tiene cliente

Los montos facturables y de costos de la entrada se calculan en la **moneda del cliente** si:

* el proyecto de entrada tiene un cliente con una moneda específica asignada

Para las entradas importadas, la moneda se deriva del proyecto.

La moneda está relacionada con el cliente, no con la entrada, por lo que si la moneda se cambia a nivel de cliente, todas las entradas asignadas a los proyectos de esos clientes obtendrán una nueva moneda. Además, si se elimina un proyecto o un cliente relacionado con ese proyecto, todas las entradas de tiempo relacionadas con ese proyecto obtienen la moneda predeterminada.

#### Gastos #

En caso de que la moneda sea asignada al cliente, se seguirá utilizando la  **moneda predeterminada** cuando:

* se añade una nueva categoría de gastos que tenga un precio unitario
* el proyecto del gasto se elimina del espacio de trabajo.
* el cliente del proyecto se elimina del espacio de trabajo.

Si la moneda del cliente o la moneda predeterminada cambian, esos cambios no afectarán los registros ya existentes, solo los futuros.

#### Informe #

Puedes filtrar informes por monedas o buscar una moneda en la barra de búsqueda en la parte superior de la página.

Se muestran diferentes monedas de los clientes en informes resumidos, informes de tiempo y gastos y formatos exportados.

## Chunk 4

or de la página.

Se muestran diferentes monedas de los clientes en informes resumidos, informes de tiempo y gastos y formatos exportados.

#### Proyecto #

La moneda que se muestra en los proyectos es la relacionada con el cliente. Si no hay ningún cliente en el proyecto, se muestra la moneda predeterminada.

#### Facturas  #

Dado que todas las facturas se realizan para un cliente específico, el monto se muestra en la moneda del cliente. Si se actualiza la factura del cliente, la factura existente también se actualiza a esa moneda.

## Chunk 1

Caso você esteja trabalhando em projetos para clientes que usam várias moedas, em vez de usar uma moeda no nível do espaço de trabalho para todos os seus projetos, você pode atribuir moedas diferentes a clientes diferentes.

Por exemplo: *O Cliente A está usando dólares americanos como moeda e o Cliente B euros. Você pode registrar despesas relacionadas ao projeto em dólares americanos para o Cliente A e em euros para o Cliente B.*

A moeda atribuída no nível do espaço de trabalho é atribuída por padrão a todos os clientes disponíveis no espaço de trabalho. Para atribuir moeda a um cliente, você precisa ser administrador e seu espaço de trabalho precisa estar em um **PRO** ou plano de assinatura superior.

#### Teste #

* Após o rebaixamento ou o final de um período de teste, todas as moedas serão alteradas de volta para a moeda padrão
* A assinatura restaura as configurações de moeda que estavam em vigor antes do período de teste

A moeda está presente em todas as ações relacionadas ao cliente, desde a criação ou edição do cliente, até a visão geral do valor no painel, status do projeto e assim por diante. Se uma moeda diferente do padrão for atribuída a um cliente, isso afetará **a adição de entradas de tempo** em todo o aplicativo e **Clientes**, **Despesas**, **Relatórios**, páginas **Projetos** e **Faturas**.

#### Clientes #

Por padrão, cada cliente padrão recebe uma moeda padrão do espaço de trabalho.

Sempre que a moeda relativa ao cliente mudar, serão apresentados os valores da moeda atualizados, sendo a nova marcada como atualizada.

* a entrada do projeto tem um cliente com moeda específica atribuída

Para entradas importadas, a moeda é derivada do projeto.

A moeda está relacionada ao cliente, não à entrada, portanto, se a moeda for alterada no nível do cliente, todas as entradas atribuídas aos projetos deste cliente receberão uma nova moeda. Além disso, se um projeto ou cliente relacionado a esse projeto for excluído, todas as entradas de tempo relacionadas a esse projeto receberão a moeda padrão.

#### Despesas #

Caso a moeda seja atribuída ao cliente,a **moeda padrão** ainda será usada quando:

* adicionar uma nova categoria de despesas que tenha um preço unitário
* o projeto da despesa é excluído do espaço de trabalho
* o cliente do projeto é excluído do espaço de trabalho

Se a moeda do cliente ou a moeda padrão for alterada, essas alterações não afetarão os registros já existentes, apenas os futuros.

#### Relatório #

Você pode filtrar os relatórios por moedas ou encontrar uma moeda na barra de pesquisa na parte superior da página.

Diferentes moedas do cliente são exibidas em relatórios resumidos, relatórios de tempo e despesas e formatos exportados.

# [ARTICLE] Assign currency to client - Clockify Help
https://clockify.me/help/track-time-and-expenses/assign-currency-to-client/

# Assign currency to client - Clockify Help


## Chunk 1

In case you’re working on projects for clients that use various currencies, instead of using one currency on a workspace level for all your projects, you can assign different currencies to different clients.

For example: *Client A is using US dollars as a currency and Client B euros. You can record project-related expenses in US dollars for Client A and in euros for Client B.*

The currency assigned on a workspace level is assigned by default to all the clients available in the workspace. To assign currency to a client, you need to be an admin and your workspace needs to be on a **PRO** or higher subscription plan.

Assign currency #
-----------------

To assign currency to client:

1. Go to the **Clients** page in your workspace
2. In the list of **Clients,** locatetheclient you wish to edit
3. Click on the **Edit** button next to their name
4. Choose the currency from the search bar that appears with all available currencies in the workspace

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-06-at-16.27.18-10-658x1024.png)

Currency assigned to a client will be referred to as **client currency** hereafter.

Client currency in Clockify #
-----------------------------

#### Trial #

* After downgrade or the end of a trial period, all currencies are changed back to the default currency
* Subscription restores currency settings that were in place before


## Chunk 2

he end of a trial period, all currencies are changed back to the default currency
* Subscription restores currency settings that were in place before the trial period

Currency is present in all client-related actions, from the client creation or editing, to the amount overview in the dashboard, project status and so on. If other than default currency is assigned to a client, it affects **adding time entries** throughout the app and **Clients**, **Expenses**, **Reports**, **Projects** and **Invoices** pages.

#### Clients #

By default, every default client gets a default workspace currency.

Whenever the currency related to the client changes, updated currency values will be presented with the new one being marked as updated.

#### Adding time entries in Time tracker, Timesheet, Calendar, Detailed report #

Entry’s billable and cost amounts are calculated in **default currency** if:

* entry doesn’t have a project
* entry’s project doesn’t have a client

Entry’s billable and cost amounts are calculated in **client currency** if:

* entry’s project has a client with assigned specific currency

For imported entries, currency is derived from the project.

Currency is related to the client, not entry, so if the currency is changed on a client level, all entries assigned to those client’s projects will get a new currency. Also, if a project or a client related to that project is de


## Chunk 3

a client level, all entries assigned to those client’s projects will get a new currency. Also, if a project or a client related to that project is deleted, all time entries related to that project get the default currency.

#### Expenses #

In case currency is assigned to client,the **default currency** is still used when:

* adding a new expense category that has a unit price
* expense’s project is deleted from the workspace
* project’s client is deleted from the workspace

If client currency, or default currency changes, those changes will not impact the already existing records, only the future ones.

#### Report #

You can filter out reports by currencies, or find a currency in the search bar at the top of the page.

Different client currencies are displayed in summary report, time and expense reports and exported formats.

#### Project #

The currency displayed in projects is the one related to the client. If there is no client on the project, the default currency is displayed.

#### Invoices  #

Since all invoices are made for a specific client, the amount is displayed in client currency. If the client’s invoice is updated, the existing invoice is updated to that currency, as well.

For more information on how to create multiple currencies in a workspace, check out Set up multiple currencies.

# Assignments report - Clockify Help


## Chunk 1

Assignments report helps you keep track of your tasks by comparing the assignments you’ve scheduled with the time you’ve actually spent on them with a breakdown of cost and billable amounts for scheduled and tracked time. This article will show you how to use assignment reports effectively so that you can easily manage your workload and monitor financial data over selected period.

This is a paid feature available to all users when upgrading a workspace to a Pro or Enterprise plan.

Assignments report might come in handy in the following case:

*Let’s say that as a project manager you are overseeing a software development project with multiple assigned tasks and team members. You check the* ***Assignments*** *report for the past month to compare scheduled assignments with the actual tracked time by your development team. The report reveals that certain tasks took longer than initially estimated. With this insight, you can identify areas for improvement, like refining task estimates, adjusting project timelines, or redistributing workload.*

See assignments #
-----------------

Keep in mind that in order to see the report, Scheduling needs to be enabled in the Workspace settings.

To do that:

1. Navigate to the workspace name at the top of the page
2. Open the menu and choose the **Workspace settings**
3. Find the **Scheduling** section in the **General** tab
4. Toggle the swit

he top of the page
2. Open the menu and choose the **Workspace settings**
3. Find the **Scheduling** section in the **General** tab
4. Toggle the switch to **Activate project and team scheduling**
5. Optionally, enable the **Regular users can see everyone’s assignments** option

Now that you’ve enabled **Scheduling**, you can check out the Assignments report:

1. Go to the **Reports** in the sidebar
2. Choose the **Assignments** from the dropdown

Assignments report displays:

* Total scheduled time for published assignments
* Cost and billable amounts for scheduled and tracked time
* Total tracked time
* Difference between scheduled and tracked time
* Performance column with progress bar

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Table-1024x385.png)

In order to see the breakdown of cost and billable amounts, you need to have either the **Activate billable rate** or **Activate cost rate** enabled in the Workspace settings.

As a result, you’ll see the following additional columns:

* **Amount column**: Displays the total amount for scheduled and tracked time
* **Cost column**: Displays the total cost for scheduled and tracked time
* **Difference column**: Includes both Amount and Cost calculations

The results on the page can be grouped on three levels based on the entities you choose.

Group entries #
---------------

When you’re analyzing the Assignments report, you have the option to group entries in three levels. As a result, the report will organize the data based on the intersection of these criteria and the total hours tracked by users within those groups.

* First level of grouping: **User**, **Group**, **Client**, **Month**, **Week**, or **Date**
* Second level of grouping: **Project**, **Task**, **Client**, **Group**, **Month**, **Week**, or **Date**
* Third level of grouping: **Task**, **Group**, **Month**, **Week**, or **Date**

*For example, you might choose to first group your Attendance report by* ***Project****, then within each project, group by* ***Task****, and finally, within each task, further divide by* ***Date****.*

Project > Task > Date

In the **Attendance** report, this grouping look like this:

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/assignments_report_groups-1024x429.png)

You can also filter the results by date in the date picker, team (users and groups), client or project and export them in **CSV**/**Excel** format.

If you, for instance, group by User or Group, you’ll get **available** and **scheduled** hours and, in that way, can determine user’s availability for the selected date range.

1. At the top right corner of the page, click the **Export** button to expand dropdown
2. Choose preferred format **CSV**/**Excel**

The report will be downloaded and saved on your computer.

The grouping options affect the way your exports look. For example, if you group by project, further group by task and finally group by date, that’s the way data will be grouped in the export, as well.

# Assinatura e atualização do Clockify


## Chunk 1

Descubra maior controle com as ferramentas pagas do Clockify. Inscreva-se agora e redefina sua experiência de rastreamento de tempo. Opte pelo plano de assinatura que você mais gosta, com o preço por usuário, e transforme seu espaço de trabalho em um ambiente mais avançado.

Antes de atualizar, certifique-se de estar conectado ao seu espaço de trabalho.

Lembre-se de que o custo da atualização depende do número de membros ativos da equipe, independentemente de suas funções ou dos recursos que utilizam.

Conceitos principais #
----------------------

Familiarize-se com os principais conceitos e processos que você pode encontrar ao trabalhar com atualizações e assinaturas no Clockify.

### Faturamento e assentos #

Esteja ciente de que você será cobrado a cada ciclo de cobrança pelo **total number** de assentos de usuário que você tem. Portanto, se você tiver mais assentos de usuário do que os usuários ativos no espaço de trabalho, você será cobrado por **todos os assentos de usuário** sejam eles usados ou não.

Você só precisa comprar um assento para um usuário ativo no seu espaço de trabalho. Se um usuário for desativado, remova manualmente o assento dele da página **Assinatura**. Usuários ativados contam como assentos usados ​​e o número total de assentos representa o número de assentos disponíveis naquele espaço de trabalho.

Por exemplo: *Você pagou uma assinatura anual para


## Chunk 2

o número total de assentos representa o número de assentos disponíveis naquele espaço de trabalho.

Por exemplo: *Você pagou uma assinatura anual para dois assentos de usuário. Você teve dois usuários ativos por alguns meses e então desativou um. Agora, você tem um assento de usuário vago e pode convidar novos usuários que ocuparão esse assento. Isso significa que cada vez que você desativa um usuário, você libera um assento que ele costumava ocupar.*

### Assentos de usuários #

Representa o número de membros ativos da equipe que você pode ter em seu espaço de trabalho. Ao assinar um plano pago pela primeira vez, você deve comprar um assento para cada usuário ativo, mas também pode comprar mais assentos se planeja convidar mais usuários no futuro.

### Pacote de assentos #

Representar vários membros ativos nos espaços de trabalho Clockify, Pumble e Plaky adquiridos com o plano de assinatura de pacote dentro do CAKE.com Productivity Suite.

Para obter instruções detalhadas sobre como gerenciar as licenças do pacote, consulte o artigo o Pacote de assinaturas.

### Integrante da equipe #

Um integrante da equipe é todo **usuário ativo** que ingressa ou é convidado no espaço de trabalho, independentemente da função de usuário e das ferramentas que utiliza. Cada vez que um novo usuário ingressa ou é convidado para seu espaço de trabalho, ele ocupa uma vaga de usuário. Se não houve


## Chunk 3

ferramentas que utiliza. Cada vez que um novo usuário ingressa ou é convidado para seu espaço de trabalho, ele ocupa uma vaga de usuário. Se não houver mais vagas de usuários disponíveis, você não poderá convidar usuários e eles não poderão ingressar no seu espaço de trabalho.

### Usuários completos e limitados #

Ao usar o quiosque, você encontrará dois tipos de usuários: Completo e Limitado. Usuários completos referem-se aos membros da equipe quando o recurso Quiosque está habilitado, enquanto usuários limitados são aqueles que têm acesso restrito e só podem registrar entrada/saída conforme necessário.
Se você quiser adicionar usuários limitados ao seu espaço de trabalho, você será cobrado por isso separadamente.

Gerenciar assentos de usuários #
--------------------------------

Se você usou todos os assentos de usuário disponíveis em seu espaço de trabalho, poderá adicionar mais usuários comprando assentos adicionais na página de  **Assinatura** do aplicativo.

Somente proprietários/administradores do espaço de trabalho podem gerenciar assinaturas e adicionar/remover assentos de usuários.

### Página de assinatura do Clockify #

A página **Assinatura** permite que você gerencie assentos de usuário, tenha uma visão geral de todas as suas faturas e planos de assinatura com a opção de fazer upgrade/downgrade para o plano de assinatura que atenda às suas necessidades.

https://clockify.me/help/fr/track-time-and-expenses/assign-currency-to-client/

# Attribuer une devise à un client - Aide Clockify


## Chunk 1

Si vous travaillez sur des projets pour des clients qui utilisent différentes devises, au lieu d'utiliser une seule devise au niveau de l'espace de travail pour tous vos projets, vous pouvez assigner différentes devises à différents clients.

Par exemple : *Le client A utilise le dollar américain comme devise et le client B l'euro. Vous pouvez enregistrer les dépenses liées au projet en dollars américains pour le client A et en euros pour le client B.*

La devise assignée au niveau d'un espace de travail est assignée par défaut à tous les clients disponibles dans l'espace de travail. Pour assigner une devise à un client, vous devez être un administrateur et votre espace de travail doit être sur un plan d'abonnement **PRO** ou supérieur.

Attribuer une devise #
----------------------

Pour assigner une devise à un client :

1. Accédez à la page **Clients** de votre espace de travail
2. Dans la liste des **Clients,** retrouvezleclient que vous souhaitez modifier
3. Cliquez sur le bouton **Modifier** à côté de son nom
4. Choisissez la devise dans la barre de recherche qui apparaît avec toutes les devises disponibles dans l'espace de travail

--------------------------------

#### Essai #

* Une fois passé à un plan inférieur ou la fin d'une période d'essai, toutes les devises sont ramenées à la devise par défaut
* L'abonnement rétablit les paramètres de devise qui étaient en place avant la période d'essai

La devise est présente dans toutes les actions liées au client, depuis la création ou l'édition du client, jusqu'à l'aperçu du montant dans le tableau de bord, le statut du projet, etc. Si une devise autre que la devise par défaut est assignée à un client, cela affecte **l'ajout d'entrées de temps** dans l'application et dans les pages **Clients**, **Dépenses**, **Rapports**, **Projets** et **Factures**.

#### Clients #

Par défaut, chaque client reçoit une devise par défaut pour son espace de travail.

Chaque fois que la devise liée au client change, les valeurs actualisées de la devise seront présentées, la nouvelle étant marquée comme mise à jour.

#### Ajout d'entrées de temps dans le Suivi du temps, la Feuille de temps, le Calendrier, le Rapport détaillé #

Les montants facturables et les coûts de l'entrée sont calculés dans la **devise par défaut** si :

## Chunk 3

* l'entrée n'a pas de projet
* le projet de l'entrée n'a pas de client

Les montants facturables et les coûts de l'entrée sont calculés dans la **devise du client** si :

* le projet de l'entrée a un client auquel une devise spécifique a été assignée

Pour les entrées importées, la devise est dérivée du projet.

La devise est liée au client et non à l'entrée, donc si la devise est modifiée au niveau d'un client, toutes les entrées affectées aux projets de ce client obtiendront une nouvelle devise. De même, si un projet ou un client lié à ce projet est supprimé, toutes les entrées de temps liées à ce projet reçoivent la devise par défaut.

#### Dépenses #

Dans le cas où la devise est assignée au client, la **devise par défaut** est toujours utilisée lorsque :

* une nouvelle catégorie de dépenses ayant un prix unitaire est ajoutée
* le projet de la dépense est supprimé de l'espace de travail
* le client du projet est supprimé de l'espace de travail

Si la devise du client ou la devise par défaut change, ces changements n'auront pas d'impact sur les enregistrements existants, mais uniquement sur les enregistrements futurs.

#### Rapport #

Vous pouvez filtrer les rapports par devise ou trouver une devise dans la barre de recherche en haut de la page.

## Chunk 4

arre de recherche en haut de la page.

Les différentes devises des clients sont affichées dans les rapports résumés, les rapports de temps et de dépenses et les formats exportés.

#### Projet #

La devise affichée dans les projets est celle liée au client. S'il n'y a pas de client dans le projet, la devise par défaut est affichée.

#### Factures  #

Comme toutes les factures sont établies pour un client spécifique, le montant est affiché dans la devise du client. Si la facture du client est mise à jour, la facture existante est également mise à jour dans cette devise.

# Audit de temps - Clockify Centre d'aide


## Chunk 1

Audit de temps
==============

L'audit de temps vous aide à trouver et à corriger les entrées de temps erronées.

Les audits peuvent être menés aussi bien par les administrateurs que par les utilisateurs réguliers :

* L'administrateur peut trouver toutes les entrées incorrectes dans l'ensemble de l'espace de travail en un seul clic et les corriger
* Les membres de l'équipe peuvent trouver leurs saisies incomplètes en un clic et les corriger

L'audit de temps est une fonctionnalité payante, que vous pouvez activer en mettant à niveau votre espace de travail vers l'un des plans payants.

Pour enregistrer et analyser les modifications apportées aux entrées de temps (par exemple, qui a modifié l'heure de début, supprimé l'entrée, etc.), vous pouvez utiliser la fonctionnalité de Journal d'audit.

Quand utiliser l'audit de temps #
---------------------------------

* Lorsque vous êtes au milieu de quelque chose, vous voulez simplement lancer un minuteur et ajouter un projet/catégoriser la saisie plus tard.
* Lorsque vous devez ranger les feuilles de temps avant de facturer les clients et que vous devez retrouver les entrées que votre équipe a oublié de classer par catégorie.
* Lorsque vous retrouvez les saisies de temps que vous avez fait par accident (moins d'une minute ou plus de 8 heures) afin de les supprimer.

# Audit log - Clockify Help


## Chunk 1

Record every activity within your workspace and get a comprehensive record of actions, users that initiated them and timestamps for easy reference later on.

Audit log is a paid feature, which you can enable by upgrading your workspace to the ENTERPRISE plan.

Enable audit log #
------------------

To start recording actions:

1. Open the menu next to the workspace name
2. Choose **Workspace settings**
3. Activate audit log
4. Select change you wish to record (change to time entries, projects, clients, tags)

For example, if you check time entries, you’ll get a record in audit log whenever someone creates a new time entry, edits their existing entry, or deletes it.

Audit log also records cascade changes. For example, if you have a time entry on some project, and that project is updated (e.g. it’s renamed or deleted), you’ll get a record log for both **Project updated** and for **Time entry updated**. This only happens if you record both changes in workspace settings. For example, if you record changes to time entries but not to projects, you won’t get a record in audit log when a project is updated.

Run audit #
-----------

1. Open the menu next to the workspace name
2. Choose **Workspace settings** > **Audit** tab
3. Choose date
4. Choose author
5. Choose actions
6. Click **Run report**

4. Choose author
5. Choose actions
6. Click **Run report**

Once you get the report, you can review events in the table (timestamp, author, and action), and expand for more details.

You can also export audit log as a CSV file and analyze it in Excel or some other program.

Because audit log files can be huge, it takes a while to generate them. You can wait and download it once it’s finished, or you can choose to receive it via email within half an hour.

Audit logs older than 1 year are automatically deleted (due to their enormous size). We recommend exporting them each month and storing them personally for archive purposes.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/audit_log_running_report-1024x487.png)

Filter logs #

You can filter audit log by:

### Actions #

### Authors (users) #

Authors are all active or archived workspace users.

Maximum date range is 30 days.

Previous and new value of ‘update’ events #
-------------------------------------------

‘Update’ events in Audit log contain more details about what has been updated on your workspace (e.g. project name change, setting up billable rate, added estimate…). Once you expand the event on the Audit log page in the report you run, you’ll get more information about the ‘update’ event in question.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/expand_update_event-1024x525.png)

‘Update’ event: rename project

We recommend enabling Audit log from the moment you start using Clockify. This way, you will always have previous and new value of all your ‘update’ events. If you use Clockify and enable Audit log for some object later, you might not have access to the previous value because it wasn’t recording events at that moment.

*For example, if you create a time entry while audit log is off, and you later enable it and you update the same entry, audit log will show that it’s been updated but you won’t be able to compare the previous and new value. However, if you update that entry again, audit log will show both the previous edit as previous value and what exactly has been updated in the new value.*

# Aufgaben verwenden - Clockify-Hilfe


## Chunk 1

Du kannst Zeiteinträge noch weiter kategorisieren, indem du Aufgaben verwendest (zusätzlich zur Verwendung von Tags, Kunden und Projekten). Aufgaben bieten dir eine zusätzliche Hierarchiestufe und können als Unterprojekte dienen.

De Aufgaben werden meist für eine Tätigkeit verwendet (z. B. Design, Codierung) und das Beschreibungsfeld für die tatsächliche Sache, an der du gearbeitet hast (z. B. "Arbeit am Fehler Nr. 213"). Für eine erweiterte Aufgabenverwaltung ist es am besten, ein spezielles Projektmanagement-Tool wie Plaky, Trello, JIRA, usw. zu verwenden.

Du kannst zum Beispiel Aufgaben nach Art der Arbeit benennen ("Front-End-Programmierung", "Schreiben", "Entwerfen") und später im Zusammenfassungsbericht die Zeiteinträge nach Aufgaben in Untergruppen einteilen, um zu sehen, wie viel Zeit jede Aktivität in Anspruch genommen hat.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-20-at-16.07.21-1024x538.png)

Aufgaben erstellen #
--------------------

So erstellst du eine Aufgabe:

1. Zu einem Projekt gehen
2. Registerkarte "Aufgaben" öffnen
3. Aufgabenname eingeben
4. Auf "Hinzufügen" klicken, und die Mitarbeiter können es dann bei der Zeiterfassung auswählen.

Du kannst:

* angeben, wer an welcher Aufgabe arbeitet, indem du eine zugewiesene Person auswählst
* einen Zeitvoranschlag für jede Aufgabe festlegen, sobald du diesen auf der Registerkarte


## Chunk 2

ufgabe arbeitet, indem du eine zugewiesene Person auswählst
* einen Zeitvoranschlag für jede Aufgabe festlegen, sobald du diesen auf der Registerkarte "Projekteinstellungen" aktiviert hast (dies kann nützlich sein, wenn du deinem Kunden eine bestimmte Anzahl von Stunden für jede Art von Arbeit angeboten hast, damit du den Fortschritt der Arbeit verfolgen kannst)

Um den Aufgabennamen zu ändern, solltest du einfach auf den Namen klicken und eingeben, was du möchtest.

Standardmäßig können **Besitzer** und **Adminstratoren** Aufgaben erstellen. Diese Berechtigungen können jedoch geändert werden, wenn **"Wer kann Projekte und Kunden erstellen"** auf  **"Admins und Manager"**  oder **"Jeder"**  in den **Arbeitsbereichseinstellungen** festgelegt ist.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image_0-9.png)

Wer kann Aufgaben erstellen, wenn ausgewählt:

* **Admins** (Standard): Admins
* **Admins und Projektmanager**: Admins und Projektmanager
* **Jeder**: Administratoren, Projektmanager, Teammanager, reguläre Benutzer

Aufgaben als erledigt markieren #
---------------------------------

Wenn du mit einer Aufgabe fertig bist, kannst du sie als fertig markieren, damit sie dir nicht im Weg steht:

* Erledigte Aufgaben werden erst auf der Projektseite angezeigt, wenn du "Fertig anzeigen" oder "Alle Aufgaben anzeigen" auswählst.
* Erledigte Aufgaben werden bei der Zeiterfa


## Chunk 3

n erst auf der Projektseite angezeigt, wenn du "Fertig anzeigen" oder "Alle Aufgaben anzeigen" auswählst.
* Erledigte Aufgaben werden bei der Zeiterfassung nicht in der Projektauswahl angezeigt
* Die erfasste Zeit für erledigte Aufgaben wird in Berichten angezeigt

Das Markieren von Aufgaben als erledigt ist sehr nützlich, wenn du viele Aufgaben in Projekten hast und Projekte als Aufgaben organisierst (der andere Arbeitsablauf besteht darin, Arten von Aktivitäten als Aufgaben zu definieren, wie z. B. Codierung oder Design, in diesem Fall ist es nicht notwendig, Aufgaben abzuschließen).

Aufgaben Benutzer zuweisen #
----------------------------

Wenn eine Aufgabe "Jeder" als zugewiesene Person hat, kann jeder, der Zugriff auf dieses Projekt hat, die Aufgabe auswählen und die Zeit erfassen.

Wenn eine Aufgabe einem bestimmten Benutzer oder einer Gruppe zugewiesen ist, kann nur diese Person die Aufgabe auswählen und die Zeit erfassen.

Wenn es sich um ein privates Projekt handelt, musst du die Person zunächst zu diesem Projekt hinzufügen.

Aufgaben aus Vorlagen hinzufügen #
----------------------------------

Wenn du häufig Projekte mit der gleichen Aufgabenstruktur erstellst, kannst du eine Vorlage einrichten, damit du diese Aufgaben nicht jedes Mal einzeln hinzufügen musst, wenn du ein neues Projekt erstellst.

Bei Projekten, die du mithilfe einer bestehenden Vorlage erstellst,


## Chunk 4

n nicht jedes Mal einzeln hinzufügen musst, wenn du ein neues Projekt erstellst.

Bei Projekten, die du mithilfe einer bestehenden Vorlage erstellst, sind Einstellungen wie Aufgaben, abrechenbare Sätze, Voranschläge und Team bereits vorhanden.

Die Projektvorlagen sind eine kostenpflichtige Funktion, die du aktivieren kannst, sobald du dein Konto aktualisierst.

Aufgaben löschen #
------------------

Um eine Aufgabe zu löschen, musst du sie zunächst als fertig markieren. Du solltest dann erneut auf die Optionen zur Aufgabe klicken und du siehst die Option "Löschen".

Nur Administratoren und Projektmanager können Aufgaben löschen.

Sobald eine Aufgabe gelöscht wird, werden alle Zeiteinträge für diese Aufgabe ohne Aufgabe sein (aber sie werden das Projekt beibehalten).

Sätze und Abrechnungsstatus #
-----------------------------

Wenn du Stundensätze festlegen und markieren möchtest, welche Aufgaben abrechenbar sind, musst du Aufgabensätze in den Arbeitsbereichseinstellungen aktivieren.

# Aufgabenbericht - Clockify-Hilfe


## Chunk 1

Der Aufgabenbericht hilft dir dabei, Aufgaben zu verfolgen, indem die geplanten Aufgaben mit der Zeit verglichen werden, die für Aufgaben tatsächlich aufgewendet wurden, plus die Aufschlüsselung von Kosten und abrechenbaren Beträgen für geplante und erfasste Zeiten. Im Artikel wird erklärt, wie du den Aufgabenbericht effektiv verwendest und dadurch deine Arbeitsbelastung einfach verwaltest.

Das ist eine kostenpflichtige Funktion für alle Benutzer, die ihren Arbeitsbereich auf den Pro- oder Enterprise-Abonnementplan aktualisieren.

Der Aufgabenbericht kann im folgenden Fall nützlich sein:

*Angenommen, dass du als Projektmanager ein Softwareentwicklungsprojekt mit mehreren zugewiesenen Aufgaben und Teammitgliedern leitest. In diesem Fall kannst du dir den* ***Aufgabenbericht*** *für den vorigen Monat ansehen, um geplante Aufträge mit der von deinem Entwicklungsteam tatsächlich erfassten Zeit zu vergleichen. Der Bericht entdeckt, dass bestimmte Aufgaben mehr Zeit als ursprünglich geplant genommen haben. Mit diesem Einblick kannst du Bereiche identifizieren, die verbessert werden können, wie Aufgabenschätzungen verfeinern, Projektzeitleiste anpassen oder Arbeitslast neu verteilen.*

Aufgaben anzeigen #
-------------------

Beachte, dass die Zeitplanung in Einstellungen deines Arbeitsbereichs aktiviert werden soll, um den Bericht anzusehen.

So funktioniert es:

## Chunk 2

dass die Zeitplanung in Einstellungen deines Arbeitsbereichs aktiviert werden soll, um den Bericht anzusehen.

So funktioniert es:

1. Zum Arbeitsbereichsnamen oben auf der Seite navigieren
2. Menü öffnen und **Arbeitsbereichseinstellungen** wählen
3. Abschnitt **"Zeitplanung"** in der Registerkarte **"Allgemein"** finden
4. Schalter einschalten, um **Projekt- und Teamplanung** zu aktivieren
5. Optional kannst du **"Reguläre Benutzer können alle Aufgaben sehen"** aktivieren

Jetzt hast du die **Zeitplanung** aktiviert und du kannst den Aufgabenbericht überprüfen:

1. Gehe zu **Berichten** in der Seitenleiste
2. Wähle **Aufgaben** aus dem Dropdown-Menü

Im Aufgabenbericht wird angezeigt:

* Geplante Gesamtzeit für veröffentlichte Aufträge
* Kosten und abrechenbare Beträge für geplante und erfasste Zeiten
* Erfasste Gesamtzeit
* Unterschied zwischen geplanten und erfassten Zeit
* Leistungsspalte mit der Fortschrittsleiste

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Table-1024x385.png)

Um Aufschlüsselungen von Kosten und abrechenbaren Beträgen, musst du entweder **Abrechenbare Sätze aktivieren** oder **Kostensatz aktivieren** in Einstellungen deines Arbeitsbereichs aktivieren.

Demzufolge kannst du folgende zusätzliche Spalten sehen:

* **Betragsspalte**: In der Spalte wird der Gesamtbetrag für geplante und erfasste Zeiten angezeigt
* **Kostenspalte**: In der Spalte


## Chunk 3

Spalten sehen:

* **Betragsspalte**: In der Spalte wird der Gesamtbetrag für geplante und erfasste Zeiten angezeigt
* **Kostenspalte**: In der Spalte werden die Gesamtkosten für geplante und erfasste Zeiten angezeigt
* **Unterschied-Spalte**: Die Spalte umfasst sowohl Betrag als auch Kostenberechnungen

Die Ergebnisse auf dieser Seite können basierend auf den von dir gewählten Einheiten in drei Stufen gruppiert werden.

Gruppeneinträge #
-----------------

Wenn du den Aufgabenbericht analysierst, hast du die Möglichkeit, Einträge in drei Stufen zu gruppieren. Als Ergebnis organisiert der Bericht die Daten basierend auf dem Schnittpunkt dieser drei Kriterien und der von Benutzern in diesen Gruppen erfassten Gesamtzeiten.

* Erste Gruppierungsstufe: **Benutzer**, **Gruppe**, **Kunde**, **Monat**, **Woche**, oder **Datum**
* Zweite Gruppierungsstufe: **Projekt**, **Aufgabe**, **Kunde**, **Gruppe**, **Monat**, **Woche**, oder **Datum**
* Dritte Gruppierungsstufe: **Aufgabe**, **Gruppe**, **Monat**, **Woche**, oder **Datum**

*Du kannst zum Beispiel dich zuerst entscheiden, deinen Auftragsbericht nach* ***Projekt****, dann innerhalb jedes Projekts, weiter nach* ***Aufgabe****, und innerhalb jeder Aufgabe zu gruppieren und schließlich nach* ***Datum*** *zu unterteilen.*

Projekt > Aufgabe > Datum

Im **Aufgabenbericht** wird das so angezeigt:

Projekt > Aufgabe > Datum

Im **Aufgabenbericht** wird das so angezeigt:

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/assignments_report_groups-1024x429.png)

Außerdem kannst du die Ergebnisse in der Datumsauswahl nach Datum, Team (Benutzer oder Gruppen), Kunden oder Projekt filtern und sie im **CSV**/**Excel**-Format exportieren.

Wenn du beispielsweise nach Benutzer oder Gruppe gruppierst, erhältst du **verfügbare** und **geplante**  Stunden und auf diese Weise kannst du die Verfügbarkeit der Benutzer für den ausgewählten Datumsbereich festlegen.

Aufgabenbericht exportieren #
-----------------------------

Wenn du den Aufgabenbericht erhalten möchtest und ihn im CSV- oder Excel-Format an Fachexperten, betroffene Parteien oder innerbetrieblich verteilen, kannst du dies auf der Seite **"Aufgaben"** tun.

1. Klicke die Schaltfläche **"Export"** in der rechten Seitenecke oben an, um das Dropdown-Menü zu erweitern

# Aufgabensätze - Clockify-Hilfe


## Chunk 1

In einem Projekt kannst du unterschiedliche Sätze für Aufgaben festlegen, wenn du für jede erledigte Aufgabe einen anderen Satz berechnest. Du kannst auch kontrollieren, ob Aufgaben standardmäßig abrechenbar oder nicht abrechenbar sind.

Aufgabensätze sind eine der kostenpflichtigen Funktionen, die du aktivierst, wenn du deinen Arbeitsbereich auf den Standard-, Pro- oder Enterprise-Plan aktualisierst.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-07-at-13.31.21-1024x548.png)

Stundensätze für Aufgaben #
---------------------------

Um Sätze für Aufgaben einzugeben, solltest du zuerst Aufgabensätze in Einstellungen des Arbeitsbereichs aktivieren.

Sobald Aufgabensätze aktiviert werden, haben alle Projekte die neue Spalte **Abrechenbare Sätze** auf ihrer Aufgabenseite. Wenn du Kostensätze aktiviert hast, werden auch **Kostensätze** angezeigt.

Ein Aufgabensatz überschreibt einen standardmäßigen abrechenbaren Projektsatz, und ein Satz für Projektmitglieder überschreibt einen Aufgabensatz (falls vorhanden). Weitere Informationen über die Hierarchie von Stundensätzen findest du hier.

Nicht nur Admins können Sätze erstellen, sondern Projektmanager auch, wenn **"Wer kann abrechenbare Sätze sehen"** in den Arbeitsbereichseinstellungen auf "Jeder" eingestellt ist.

Abrechnungsstatus von Aufgaben #

Um anzuzeigen, welche Auf


## Chunk 2

rbeitsbereichseinstellungen auf "Jeder" eingestellt ist.

Abrechnungsstatus von Aufgaben #
--------------------------------

Um anzuzeigen, welche Aufgaben abrechenbar oder nicht abrechenbar sind, solltest du abrechenbare und nicht-abrechenbare aufgaben in Arbeitsbereichseinstelllungen aktivieren.

Sobald der Status von Aufgaben als “abrechenbar” markiert ist, erhalten alle Projekte auf der Seite "Aufgaben" eine neue Spalte **"Abrechenbar"**.

Um Aufgaben als abrechenbar zu markieren, solltest du deren Abrechnungsstatus auf “Ja” festlegen und alle neuen Zeiteinträge für die Aufgabe werden zunächst als abrechenbar festgelegt.

Wenn ein Projekt als abrechenbar markiert ist, werden alle neuen Aufgaben als abrechenbar standardmäßig festgelegt.

Jeder Mitarbeiter, der auf das Projekt zugreifen kann, kann auch den Abrechnungsstatus von Aufgaben einsehen, wobei Projektmanager ihn auch bearbeiten können.

# Aufträge im Team planen - Clockify-Hilfe


## Chunk 1

Wenn du Aufträge im Team zeitlich planst, kannst du auch Projekte einfacher planen, indem du eine visuelle Zeitleiste der Team-Verfügbarkeit erstellst. Auf diese Weise kannst du einfach sehen, wer an einem Projekt/an einer Aufgabe arbeitet.

Die Planung ist eine kostenpflichtige Funktion, die du aktivieren kannst, indem du deinen Arbeitsbereich auf den PRO- oder ENTERPRISE-Abonnementsplan aktualisierst.

# Ausgaben erfassen - Clockify-Hilfe


## Chunk 1

Erfasse projekt- und aufgabenbezogene Ausgaben über die Web- oder mobile App und nimm sie in Rechnungen auf. Du kannst mit Ausgaben auch feste Gebühren (z. B. Tagessätze, Überschüsse, Überstunden, Lohn, Rückerstattungen, Gehälter usw.) und Ausgaben, die auf einer Einheit basieren (z. B. Stunden, Tage, Materialien, Kilometerleistung usw.) erfassen.

Die Ausgaben sind eine kostenpflichtige Funktion, die du aktivieren kannst, indem du deinen Arbeitsbereich auf den Pro- oder Enterprise-Plan aktualisierst.

Um Ausgaben zu verwenden, solltest du diese Funktion in den Einstellungen deines Arbeitsbereichs aktivieren.

Für eine umfassende Anleitung zu Clockify-Arbeitszeittabellen sieh dir das Video an und folge den Anweisungen unten.

Die in diesem Video angezeigte Benutzeroberfläche entspricht möglicherweise nicht der aktuellen Version der App.

Die importierte Zeit wird als **Service-** Elementtyp und Ausgabe als **Produkt-**Elementtyp angezeigt. Du kannst den Namen des Elementtyps in Rechnungseinstellungen anpassen sowie die Elementtyp-Spalte im PDF-Format ausblenden.

Jede in Rechnung gestellte Ausgabe wird als “in Rechnung gestellt” markiert, sodass du dieselbe Rechnung zufällig nicht zweimal in Rechnung stellst. Wenn du ein Zeilenelement entfernst, das importierte Ausgaben enthält (oder die gesamte Rechnung löscht), werden diese Ausgaben als “nicht in Rechnung gestellt” markiert.

Du kannst eine Ausgabe als ”in Rechnung gestellt” oder “nicht in Rechnung gestellt” im Detaillierten Ausgabenbericht immer manuell markieren, indem du sie mit Massenbearbeitung auswählst.

---------------------------------------------------

* **Benutzer-IDs der eingeschränkten Mitglieder erhalten:**:
  + Da der  `GET-/Arbeitsbereiche-/{Arbeitsbereichs-ID}-/Benutzer-`-Endpunkt keine Informationen über eingeschränkte Mitglieder bietet, musst du **Benutzer-IDs** vom Benutzergruppe-Endpunkt extrahieren
* **Kategorie-ID für Ausgaben erhalten:**:
  + Verwende den folgenden Endpunkt, um die Kategorie-ID zu erhalten:
    - `GET/Arbeitsbereiche/{Arbeitsbereichs-ID}/Ausgaben/Kategorien`
  + Stelle sicher, dass du die richtige Kategorie für die Ausgabe auswählst
* **Ausgabe erstellen:**:
  + Sobald du die Kategorie-ID hast, kannst du eine Ausgabe mit dem folgenden Endpunkt erstellen:
    - `POST/Arbeitsbereiche/{Arbeitsbereichs-ID}/Ausgaben`
  + Sende die Anfrage im **FormData-Format**, nicht im rohen JSON-Format
  + Füge in den Body Benutzer-ID des eingeschränkten Mitgliedes, Kategorie-ID und andere Ausgabeninformationen hinzu

* **Lege Headers fest:**:
  + Füge zur Authentifizierung `X-Api-Key` hinzu
  + Bestimme `Content-Type` als `multipart/form-data`
* **Body-Format:**:
  + Wähle `form-data` statt `raw` für den Body-Typ
  + Gib die folgenden Schlüssel (KEY) und die passenden Werte (VALUE) ein (ohne Anführungszeichen):
    - **KEY**: `user_id`, `date, project_id`, `category_id`, `notes`, `amount`, `billable`
    - **VALUE**: Gib die Datenwerte direkt ein (ohne Anführungszeichen vor und nach Werten)
* **Sende die Anfrage**: Überprüfe den Status der Anfrage nach der Sendung

For an overall guidance on how to use an Auto tracker, watch the video and follow the instructions below.

User interface displayed in this video may not correspond to the latest version of the app.

Enable Auto tracker #
---------------------

1. Download and install Clockify desktop app
2. Open and log in into the desktop app
3. Click on the **A icon** at the top
4. Click **Start Recording** button

Clockify for Mac on the App Store doesn’t have Auto tracker. You’ll need to install the version from our website.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-20-at-13.38.09.png)

Once you start recording, Clockify will monitor which programs you use and create records.

Auto tracker will track websites and programs you view for more than 10 seconds (apps you use less than that won’t show up). You can override this time in Auto tracker’s settings.

You can also select and add multiple entries at once.

To select multiple items, click on one item and hold Shift and click on another to select everything between, or hold Ctrl/Cmd and click on individual items to add or remove them from selection.

Right-click on selected items to:

* **Bulk add** – each item is added as a separate time entry in Clockify (you can add project/task/tag, but each entry retains its original description)
* **Bulk merge** – all selected items are added as one time entry in Clockify (each description is added, start time is taken from the earliest record, and all durations are summarized and used to calculate end time)

# Benachrichtigungen und Erinnerungen für Arbeitsbereich-Mitglieder einrichten - Clockify-Hilfe


## Chunk 1

Finde heraus, wie du Benachrichtigungen und Erinnerungen einrichtest, um den Projektfortschritt zu verfolgen und die Genauigkeit der Zeiterfassung sicherzustellen.

Nur Admins können Projektbenachrichtigungen erstellen. Projektmanager erhalten Benachrichtigungen, wenn sie für ihre Projekte so eingestellt sind, dass sie Mitteilungen erhalten. Teammanager erhalten Benachrichtigungen über den Fortschritt ihres Teams und können benachrichtigt werden, wenn Teammitglieder ihre Zeiterfassungsziele über- oder unterschreiten.

Projekt-Benachrichtigungen einrichten #
---------------------------------------

**Projekt-Benachrichtigungen** informieren dich, wenn ein Projekt einen bestimmten Prozentsatz seiner geschätzten Zeit oder Kosten erreicht. Du kannst diese Benachrichtigungen einrichten, um den Projektfortschritt zu überwachen und Überschreitungen zu vermeiden.

So richtest du Projekt-Benachrichtigungen ein:

1. Öffne das Menü **Arbeitsbereichseinstellungen**
2. Wechsle zur Registerkarte **Benachrichtigungen**
3. Wähle aus, ob du Benachrichtigungen für **Projekte** oder **Aufgaben** erhalten möchtest, und gib den Prozentsatz der geschätzten Zeit an, bei dem die Benachrichtigung ausgelöst werden soll
4. Wähle aus, wer die Benachrichtigungen erhalten soll:
   * **Alle Administratoren**
   * **Alle Projektmanager** (für ihre Projekte)
   * ****Projektmitglieder**** (für Projektbenachric

   * **Alle Administratoren**
   * **Alle Projektmanager** (für ihre Projekte)
   * ****Projektmitglieder**** (für Projektbenachrichtigungen)
   * **Aufgabenzugewiesene** (für Aufgabenbenachrichtigungen)

Klicke auf **Hinzufügen**, um die Benachrichtigung zu speichern.

### Zusätzlicher Hinweis #

* Benachrichtigungen werden gesendet, wenn der eingestellte Prozentsatz erreicht ist
* Wenn jemand seine Zeit bearbeitet und der Prozentsatz unter den Schwellenwert fällt, wird die Benachrichtigung erneut ausgelöst, sobald der eingestellte Prozentsatz wieder erreicht ist
* Benachrichtigungen gelten für alle Projekte mit Schätzungen und können nicht für einzelne Projekte eingerichtet werden
* Wenn du **nicht abrechenbare** Zeit aus den Projektschätzungen ausschließt, wird diese nicht für den Zeit-Benachrichtigung berücksichtigt
* Benachrichtigungen werden zur **30-Minuten-Marke** jeder Stunde generiert
* Nur Benutzer mit **verifizierten E-Mails** erhalten Benachrichtigungen

Benachrichtigungen entfernen #
------------------------------

So löschst du eine Benachrichtigung:

1. Klicke auf **X** neben der Benachrichtigung
2. Wähle **"Löschen"** aus

## Chunk 3

--------------------------

Du kannst Zeiterfassungsziele für dein Team (täglich, wöchentlich oder monatlich) festlegen und deine Teammitglieder automatisch per E-Mail daran erinnern, ihre Stunden zu erfassen, falls sie ihre Ziele nicht erreichen oder zu viele Stunden protokollieren.

Basierend auf ihrer Konfiguration können Erinnerungen auf drei verschiedene Weisen unterteilt werden:

* **Tägliche Erinnerung**: Wird am nächsten Tag gesendet, wenn die Ziele nicht erreicht wurden
* **Wöchentliche Erinnerung**: Wird am ersten Tag der nächsten Woche gesendet
* **Monatliche Erinnerung**: Wird am ersten Tag des nächsten Monats gesendet

So richtest du Arbeitszeittabelle-Erinnerungen ein:

1. Gehe zu **Team > Erinnerungen**
2. Lege eine **Zielstundenzahl** für deine Teammitglieder fest (täglich, wöchentlich oder monatlich)
3. Wähle, wann Erinnerungen gesendet werden sollen, basierend darauf, ob das Teammitglied **mehr** oder **weniger** als die Zielstunden erfasst
4. Klicke auf **Hinzufügen**, um die Erinnerung zu speichern

**Wichtige Hinweise**:

* Teammitglieder erhalten keine Erinnerungen, wenn sie sich im **Urlaub** oder an einem **Feiertag** befinden
* Du kannst mehrere Erinnerungen für jeden Benutzer einrichten (z. B. 7 Stunden pro Tag, 40 Stunden pro Woche, 150 Stunden pro Monat)

E-Mail-Benachrichtigungen für Manager und Admins #
--------------------------------------------------

Manager und Admins können tägliche, wöchentliche oder monatliche E-Mails über Teammitglieder erhalten, die ihre Zeitziele verfehlt oder mehr als die Zielstunden erfasst haben.

So erhältst du E-Mail-Benachrichtigungen:

1. Klicke beim Erstellen einer Erinnerung auf die Option **Sie**
2. Wähle aus, wer die E-Mail-Benachrichtigungen erhalten soll:
   * ****Administratoren****: Alle Admins erhalten E-Mails
   * **Teammanager**: Nur für ihre eigenen Teammitglieder

Admins und Manager erhalten E-Mail-Zusammenfassungen gemäß ihren persönlichen Einstellungen für **Tagesbeginn** und **Zeitzone**. Die E-Mail listet alle Personen auf, die ihre Zielstunden entweder **verfehlt** oder **überschritten** haben.

Erinnerungen bearbeiten oder entfernen #
----------------------------------------

Du kannst bestehende Erinnerungen einfach aktualisieren, falls du die Zielstunden ändern oder die Empfänger anpassen musst.

So bearbeitest du Erinnerungen:

1. Gehe zu **Erinnerungen**
2. Klicke auf den **hervorgehobenen Abschnitt** (z. B. Benutzer, Stunden usw.), um Anpassungen vorzunehmen

So entfernst du eine Erinnerung:

Klicke auf das **X** neben der Erinnerung, die du löschen möchtest.

# Benutzer einladen und Rollen in deinem Arbeitsbereich zuweisen - Clockify-Hilfe


## Chunk 1

Als Admin oder Besitzer im Arbeitsbereich ist deine Hauptaufgabe, Benutzer in deinem Arbeitsbereich zu verwalten. Dazu gehören das Einladen von Teammitgliedern, das Zuweisen von Rollen und die Verwaltung von Benutzerprofilen. Mit diesen Funktionen kannst du sicherstellen, dass dein Team den richtigen Zugriff hat, Zeiten effizient erfasst und verwaltet.

In diesem Leitfaden führen wir dich durch den Vorgang, wie du Benutzer einlädst, Rollen zuweist und Benutzereinstellungen verwaltest, um deinen Arbeitsbereich optimal einzurichten.

Benutzer in den Arbeitsbereich einladen #
-----------------------------------------

Um loszulegen, musst du zuerst Teammitglieder in deinen Arbeitsbereich einladen, damit sie Zeit erfassen. Als **Admin** oder **Besitzer** bist du der Einzige, der Benutzer in einen Arbeitsbereich einladen kann.

So lädst du Benutzer ein:

1. Gehe zur **Teamseite**
2. Je nachdem, welche Art von Mitglied du hinzufügen möchtest, wechsle zum Tab **Vollbenutzer** oder **Eingeschränkte Benutzer**
3. Klicke auf **Volle/Eingeschränkte Mitglieder hinzufügen**
4. Gib die E-Mail-Adresse des Benutzers ein, den du einladen möchtest. Du kannst mehrere Benutzer gleichzeitig einladen, indem du die E-Mail-Adressen durch Kommas trennst oder sie einzeln eingibst

   * Klicke auf **Einladung senden**, um die Einladungen zu senden

Sobald ein Benutzer die Einladung annimmt, wird er zum Mitglied des Arbeitsbereichs.

### Benutzer manuell einladen #

Wenn du Benutzer hinzugefügt hast, aber diese keine E-Mail-Einladung erhalten haben, kannst du die Einladung manuell erneut senden:

1. Gehe zur **Teamseite**
2. Klicke auf die **drei Punkte** neben dem Benutzernamen
3. Wähle **Einladungs-E-Mail senden**

Mitglieder können sich selbstständig anmelden und werden automatisch Teil deines Arbeitsbereichs (wenn sie eine ausstehende Einladung haben)

Nein, wenn du auf die Schaltfläche **Einladung senden** klickst, wird die E-Mail-Einladung automatisch gesendet.

#### Wie nehmen Benutzer die Einladung an? #

Benutzer erhalten eine E-Mail mit einem Aktivierungslink. Nachdem sie auf den Link geklickt und ihre E-Mail-Adresse verifiziert haben, können sie sich anmelden und sofort mit der Zeiterfassung für deinen Arbeitsbereich beginnen.

#### Kann ich jemanden zum Admin machen? #

Ja, das kannst du. Als **Admin** oder **Inhaber** kannst du einen Benutzer zum **Admin** befördern, indem du auf der **Teamseite** neben seinem Namen auf **+Rolle** klickst und das Kästchen **Admin** aktivierst.

#### Was ist der Unterschied zwischen dem Deaktivieren und Löschen eines Benutzers? #

Das **Deaktivieren** eines Benutzers verhindert dessen Zugriff auf den Arbeitsbereich, ermöglicht es dir aber, ihn später ohne erneute Einladung zu reaktivieren.
Das **Löschen** eines Benutzers entfernt ihn dauerhaft aus dem Arbeitsbereich, und seine Daten erscheinen nicht mehr in Berichten.

#### Kann ich einen deaktivierten Benutzer reaktivieren? #

Ja, das kannst du. Um einen Benutzer zu reaktivieren, gehe zur **Teamseite**, wähle **Alle anzeigen** oder **Inaktive Benutzer anze

#### Kann ich Benutzer in einem kostenpflichtigen Preisplan verwalten? #

Ja, du kannst Benutzer sowohl in kostenlosen als auch in kostenpflichtigen Plänen verwalten. Beachte jedoch, dass du in einem **kostenpflichtigen Plan** pro Benutzerplatz abgerechnet wirst, stelle also sicher, dass du die Anzahl deiner Benutzer im Auge behältst.

#### Was passiert, wenn ich einen Benutzer aus meinem Arbeitsbereich entferne? #

Wenn du einen Benutzer löschst, verliert er den Zugriff auf deinen Arbeitsbereich. Alle von ihm vorgenommenen Zeiteinträge bleiben jedoch weiterhin in den Berichten erhalten, du kannst aber nicht mehr nach diesem Benutzer filtern.

# Benutzer einladen und verwalten - Clockify-hilfe


## Chunk 1

In Clockify kannst du eine unbegrenzte Anzahl von Benutzern haben. Auf diese Weise kann dein gesamtes Team die Zeit erfassen. Um das zu tun, müssen sie zunächst zu deinem Arbeitsbereich eingeladen werden.

Für eine Schritt-für-Schritt-Anleitung, wie du Nutzer in Clockify einladen und verwalten kannst, sieh dir das Video an und folge den Anweisungen unten.

Die in diesem Video angezeigte Benutzeroberfläche entspricht möglicherweise nicht der aktuellen Version der App.

Nur Besitzer und Admins können neue Benutzer zu einem Arbeitsbereich einladen und ihre Details (Abrechenbaren Satz festlegen, Als inaktiv festlegen und Gruppen zuweisen) verwalten.

Benutzer einladen #
-------------------

So kannst du Benutzer zu deinem Arbeitsbereich einladen:

1. Klicke auf **Team**  in der Hauptrandleiste auf der linken Seite
2. Klicke auf **Neues Mitglied hinzufügen/Vollmitglied hinzufügen** (wenn Kiosk aktiviert ist) in der oberen rechten Ecke
3. Gib die E-Mail-Adresse der Person ein, die du einladen möchtest
4. Klicke auf **Einladung senden**

Wenn du mehrere Benutzer auf einmal einladen möchtest, solltest du die E-Mails in die dafür vorgesehenen Felder untereinander eingeben oder die Liste der E-Mails kopieren (z. B. mark@domain.com, jane@domain.com).

Wenn du einen  **kostenlosen Plan** nutzt, kannst du bis zu 5 E-Mail-Adressen gleichzeitig eingeben (Du kannst jedoch insgesamt **eine unbe

ain.com).

Wenn du einen  **kostenlosen Plan** nutzt, kannst du bis zu 5 E-Mail-Adressen gleichzeitig eingeben (Du kannst jedoch insgesamt **eine unbegrenzte Anzahl** von Benutzern einladen). Wenn du einen **kostenpflichtigen Plan** verwendest, kannst du unbegrenzt viele E-Mail-Adressen eingeben und somit eine unbegrenzte Anzahl von Benutzern gleichzeitig einladen.

Hinweis: **Kostenpflichtige Pläne werden pro Benutzerplatz abgerechnet**. Erfahre mehr über die Verwaltung von Benutzerplätzen und kostenpflichtigen Plänen hier.

Benutzer manuell einladen #
---------------------------

Wenn du ein Mitglied hinzugefügt hast, dieses aber noch keine E-Mail erhalten hat, kannst du ihm die Einladung manuell zusenden:

* Auf die drei Punkte neben dem Mitglied klicken und die Option **"Einladungs-E-Mail senden"**  auswählen.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/invite_users_manually_cake_update-1024x257.png)

Die Mitglieder können sich selbst registrieren und werden automatisch Teil deines Arbeitsbereichs (wenn sie eine ausstehende Einladung haben).

Wenn ein Mitglied bereits ein Clockify-Konto hat, muss es sich anmelden und die Einladung über die Glocken-Benachrichtigung in der oberen rechten Ecke annehmen.

If you’d like to revoke user invite, you can do that from the Members page in your CAKE.com Account.

2. Nachdem sie auf den Link geklickt hat, muss sie ihre E-Mail bestätigen
3. Die eingeladene Person kann sich dann anmelden und mit der Zeiterfassung für dich beginnen

If someone is invited to your workspace and doesn’t have a Clockify account, they can sign up and automatically join your workspace (if they have a pending invite). As a result, their CAKE.com Account will also be created.

Wenn der Benutzer bereits eingeladen ist, kann er kein Konto mit derselben E-Mail-Adresse auf der Seite **"Registrierung"** erstellen.

Wenn eine Person **bereits ein Clockify-Konto hat**, wird sie eine E-Mail und eine Benachrichtigung in Clockify erhalten. In diesem Fall sollte man die Glocken-Benachrichtigung oben rechts öffnen und auf **"Annehmen"**klicken. Dann können sie zu deinem Arbeitsbereich wechseln and start tracking time for your company.

**Reguläre Nutzer**, **Teammanager** oder **Projektmanager** können Nutzer sowohl auf den Tabs **Vollständig** als auch **Eingeschränkt** basierend auf den Informationen filtern, die sie in der Tabelle einsehen dürfen.
**Admins** und **Inhaber** haben umfassendere Filterberechtigungen, um Nutzer sowohl auf den Tabs **Vollständig** als auch **Eingeschränkt** nach all ihren Informationen zu filtern, außer nach benutzerdefinierten Feldern.

### Tabellenansicht anpassen #

Als **Besitzer** oder **Admin** kannst du deine **Team**-Tabelle personalisieren:

* **Filter hinzufügen/entfernen:** Passe an, welche Filter in deiner Filterleiste angezeigt werden.
* **Spalten auswählen/abwählen:** Wähle aus, welche Spalten in der Tabelle sichtbar sind.
* **Spalten sortieren:** Sortiere Daten nach den meisten Spalten, die einzelne Werte enthalten (z.B. Abrechnungssatz, Kostensatz, Rolle, Wochenstart, Tägliche Arbeitskapazität).

Wenn Abrechnungs- oder Kostensätze in deinem Arbeitsbereich deaktiviert und dann aktiviert werden, werden sie automatisch im Filter-Auswähler zur einfacheren Nutzung ausgewählt.

2. Klicke auf die drei Punkte neben der Person, deren Profil du bearbeiten möchtest
3. Nimm Änderungen vor:
   * Wochenbeginn des Benutzers
   * Arbeitstage definieren
   * Tägliche Arbeitsleistung des Benutzers

Wenn du die Berechtigung hast, Benutzerdaten im Fenster **Profil bearbeiten** zu bearbeiten, kannst du dieselben Daten auch direkt in der Tabelle bearbeiten, falls die entsprechende Spalte in deiner Ansicht sichtbar ist.

So bearbeitest du Benutzerdaten in der Tabelle:

1. Navigiere zu der Spalte, die die Benutzerdaten anzeigt, die du bearbeiten möchtest (z. B. die Arbeitstage des Benutzers)
2. Klicke auf die Daten

Rolle des Teammanagers zuweisen #
---------------------------------

Verbessere dein Teammanagement, indem du Teammanager direkt einzelnen Nutzern oder ganzen Gruppen zuweist.

### Benutzern zuweisen #

Als Admin kannst du jedem Nutzer einen Teammanager zuweisen. Dies ermöglicht dem Teammanager, die Zeiterfassung und Anwesenheit dieses Nutzers zu überblicken.

## Chunk 9

nn dein Abonnement auf einen **Basic**- oder **Free**-Plan herabgestuft wird, ist dieses Feld nicht mehr sichtbar.

Benutzer deaktivieren und löschen #
-----------------------------------

Wenn du einen Benutzer deaktivierst, kann er die Zeit auf deinem Arbeitsbereich nicht mehr sehen und verfolgen und er wird nicht mehr auf der Seite "Team" angezeigt.
Der Unterschied zwischen Löschen und Deaktivieren besteht darin, dass du einen Benutzer jederzeit aktivieren kannst, ohne dass er eine Einladung zum Arbeitsbereich annehmen muss.

Um einen Benutzer zu **deaktivieren** :

1. Gehe zur **Teamseite**
2. Klicke auf **die drei Punkte** neben der Person klicken, die du deaktivieren/löschen möchtest
3. Wähle **Deaktivieren**

Sobald der Benutzer nicht mehr aktiv ist, kannst du ihn löschen.

Um einen Benutzer zu **löschen** :

1. Öffne deine **Profileinstellungen**
2. Choose **Manage CAKE.com Account**
   ![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/manage_cake_account.png)
3. Du wirst zu CAKE.com-Konto deiner Organisation weitergeleitet, in dem du Änderungen vornehmen kannst

Weitere Information zum Löschen von Benutzern findest du in diesem Artikel im CAKE.com-Hilfecenter.

zigen Arbeitsbereich deaktiviert wurde, den er nutzte, wird er abgemeldet und zur Anmeldeseite weitergeleitet, um einen anderen Arbeitsbereich zu erstellen. Falls er mehr als einen Arbeitsbereich verwendet, wird es ihm weiter ermöglicht, sich im anderen Arbeitsbereich anzumelden, zu dem er gehört.

Benutzer können nur gelöscht werden, wenn sie deaktiviert sind. Wenn ein Benutzer deaktiviert wird, wird auch sein aktueller Timer gestoppt (falls er einen hat).

Die Zeiteinträge von gelöschten/aktiven Benutzern werden beibehalten, aber du kannst die Berichte nicht nach ihnen filtern. Du kannst ihre Zeit im Zusammenfassungsbericht sehen, wenn du ihn nach Benutzer gruppierst.
Additionally, the time off data of deleted users is permanently lost, even if they are reinstated.

Benutzer reaktivieren #
-----------------------

Um einen Benutzer zu **reaktivieren** :

1. Gehe zur **Teamseite**
2. Wähle **Alle anzeigen** oder **Inaktive Benutzer anzeigen** im Dropdown-Menü
3. Wähle  **Aktivieren**

Sobald ein Benutzer aktiviert ist, kann er sich wie gewohnt anmelden und die Zeit erfassen (allerdings erhält er keine E-Mail oder Benachrichtigung, dass er aktiviert wurde).

Alle inaktiven Benutzernamen werden durchgestrichen.

Benutzer-ID über API finden
===========================

Um eine **Benutzer-ID** abzurufen, solltest den folgenden Endpunkt benutzen:

**Endpunkt**:
```
GEThttps://api.clockify.me/api/v1/user

# Benutzer in unterschiedlichen Zeitzonen - Clockify-Hilfe


## Chunk 1

Benutzer in unterschiedlichen Zeitzonen
=======================================

Clockify verwendet mehrere Zeitzonen, um Zeitwerte zu erfassen und anzuzeigen:

* Zeitzone aus deinen Profileinstellungen (wenn du die Zeit in der Web-App erfasst)
* Zeitzone von deinem Gerät (wenn du die Zeit in der Desktop-/mobilen App erfasst)
* UTC (in der Datenbank gespeichert)
* Zeitzone aus deinen Profileinstellungen (wenn die aufgezeichnete Zeit angezeigt wird)

Wenn du die Zeit in der mobilen oder Desktop-App von Clockify erfasst (z. B. einen Timer startest), wird die Systemzeit deines Geräts verwendet. Wenn du die Zeit im Clockify-Web erfasst, wird die Zeit aus den Profileinstellungen verwendet. Dann konvertiert Clockify diese Zeit in UTC und sendet den konvertierten Wert an den Server. Wenn die Zeit später in Berichten angezeigt wird, wird die Zeitzone aus deinen Profileinstellungen verwendet.

Zum Beispiel:

*Jörg aus Deutschland arbeitet von 09-10 Uhr (UTC+2) und erfasst diese Zeit in Clockify. Clockify konvertiert sie in 07-08 morgens (den entsprechenden UTC-Wert) und speichert sie in der Datenbank. Wenn Emily aus New York den Bericht ausführt, sieht sie, dass Jörg von 03-04 Uhr morgens gearbeitet hat (angezeigt in ihrer UTC-4-Zeit).*

This assumes the system time zone and the time zone in the Profile Settings match. If they don’t match, you will get a notification to fix it. If you d

his assumes the system time zone and the time zone in the Profile Settings match. If they don’t match, you will get a notification to fix it. If you don’t fix it,  your timesheet and reports will show different start and end time from the one you recorded.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/time_zone_mismatch_new_menu.png)

Wenn du einen Bericht in einer anderen Zeitzone sehen möchtest (z. B. wenn du einen Bericht für Benutzer in ihrer eigenen Zeitzone analysieren möchtest), kannst du deine Zeitzone in den Profileinstellungen ändern und dann einen freigegebenen Bericht (gefiltert nach bestimmten Benutzern) erstellen, den du jederzeit öffnen kannst (der freigegebene Bericht merkt sich die Zeitzone während seiner Erstellung, sodass du sicher zu deiner Zeitzone wechseln und den gemeinsamen Bericht in der Zeitzone sehen kannst, die du während der Erstellung verwendet hast).

# Benutzerdaten-Exporte anpassen - Clockify-Hilfe


## Chunk 1

Die Anpassung der Benutzerdaten-Exportdatei ermöglicht dir, erfasste Daten auf deine besonderen Bedürfnisse anzupassen und präzise Informationen zur Analyse, zur Integration mit anderen Tools oder zu Compliance-Zwecken zu erhalten.

Das ist eine kostenpflichtige Funktion, die du aktivieren kannst, indem du deinen Arbeitsbereich auf einen der kostenpflichtigen Abonnemetpläne aktualisierst.

Um die Exporteinstellungen zu konfigurieren, solltest du:

1. Zur Seite **Team** gehen
2. Daten auswählen, die du exportieren möchtest (Registerkarte **Voll**/**Eingeschränkt**)
3. Das Dropdown-Menü **"Export"** in der rechten Ecke oben auf der Seite erweitern
4. Auf **"Anpassen"** klicken, um Daten auszuwählen, die du exportieren möchtest
5. Auf **Speichern** klicken

Jeder Benutzerdaten-Export enthält nur von dir ausgewählte Daten.

Weitere Informationen findest du im Artikel Benutzerdaten exportieren.

Der Datentyp, den du exportieren und anpassen kannst, hängt vom Benutzertyp (**Voll**/**Eingeschränkt**) und deinem Abonnementplan (**Free/Basic**/**Standard**/**Pro**/**Enterprise**) ab.

Vollbenutzer #
--------------

Die Registerkarte **"Voll"**  enthält eine Liste und Informationen über Vollmitglieder in deinem Arbeitsbereich.

Um benutzerdefinierte Exporteinstellungen zu bearbeiten, musst du auf einen der kostenpflichtigen Pläne upgraden.

### Basic-Plan #

Benutzer mit dem **Basic**-Plan können den Daten-Export anpassen, für die Daten, die im **Free**-Plan verfügbar sind.

### Standard-Plan #

Benutzer mit dem Standard-Plan haben zwei zusätzliche Spalten:

* **Projekte** (Liste mit allen aktiven und archivierten Projekten, an denen der Benutzer Projektmanager ist)
* **Teammitglieder** (Liste mit aktiven/inaktiven Mitgliedern, denen der Benutzer Teammanager ist)

Eingeschränkte Benutzer #
-------------------------

Wenn die Funktion “Kiosk” in deinem Arbeitsbereich aktiviert ist und du Benutzer hast, die den Kiosk nur zur Anmeldung und Abmeldung verwenden, hast du auch die Registerkarte **"Eingeschränkt"** mit der Liste und Daten, die in Bezug auf diese Benutzer sind.

### Kostenloser Plan #

Der Datenexport für eingeschränkte Benutzer im Free-Plan enthält:

* **Name**: Benutzername
* **Abrechnungssatz** (Benutzer-Abrechnungssatz, der in festgelegter Währung ausgedrückt ist)

* **Tägliche Arbeitskapazität**: Anzahl der Stunden, die der Benutzer täglich arbeitet

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/freeLimited.png)

Weil du über den Free-Plan verfügst, kannst du keine Daten, die im Fenster **"Export- Einstellungen"** angezeigt werden, bearbeiten.

### Basic- und Standard-Pläne #

Du kannst den Export von Daten, die im **Free**-Plan verfügbar sind, sowie die Benutzer-Kiosk-PIN anpassen, falls sie aktiviert ist.

# Benutzerdaten exportieren - Clockify-Hilfe


## Chunk 1

Wenn du viele Benutzer verwaltest und eine einzige Datei haben möchtest, in der alle ihre erfassten Daten (Name, E-Mail, Abrechnungssatz, Rolle…) zusammengefasst werden, kannst du die Funktion **"Benutzerdaten exportieren"** auf der Seite **"Teams"** benutzen.

Indem du deine Daten in eine CSV/Excel-Datei exportiert, kannst du Daten einfach analysieren und sie sogar mit anderen Tools, wie Buchhaltungssoftware, Projektmanagement-Tools oder anderen CRM (Customer Relationship Management) Systeme, integrieren.

Der Benutzerdaten-Export ist für alle Abonnementspläne verfügbar, aber kann nur von Admins durchgeführt werden.

Um Benutzerdaten zu exportieren, solltest du:

1. Zur Seite **Team** navigieren
2. Abhängig von den Daten, die du exportieren möchtest, wählen:

Du solltest fortsetzen und:

1. Das Dropdown-Menü **"Export"** in der rechten Ecke auf der Seite erweitern
2. Das Format wählen: **CSV**/**Excel**

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/export_user_data-1024x445.png)

Benutzerdaten werden auf dein Gerät exportiert.

Der Datentyp, der exportiert wird, hängt von den ausgewählten Filtern ab. Wenn aktive und inaktive Benutzer nicht anders ausgefiltert werden, werden sie standardmäßig heruntergeladen. Da eingeladene Benutzer noch keinen Namen haben, bis sie einem Arbeitsbereich beitreten, ist die Spalte **"Name"** leer.

# Benutzerdefinierte Felder - Clockify-Hilfe


## Chunk 1

Du kannst zusätzliche Felder zu den Zeiteinträgen hinzufügen und alles verfolgen!

Mit benutzerdefinierten Feldern kannst du Folgendes manuell verfolgen: Ausgaben, Kilometerleistung, Pausen, Überstunden, Rechnungsstatus, Anzahl von Einheiten, benutzerdefinierte Dropdownlisten, Quantität, Codes, Standorte, Schätzungen, Ausrüstung, Deal-Nummer, Link zum Ticket, Quittungen, Fotos, alle Arten von IDs (Rechnung, Aufgabe, Benutzer, Projekt)... und mehr!

Zusätzlich zu Benutzerdaten kannst du auch Metadaten in Projekten verfolgen - das ist perfekt, wenn du Daten in Pivottabellen analysieren oder Clockify mit externen Systemen über API integrieren solltest.

Wenn du Benutzern benutzerdefinierte Felder (z. B. Mitarbeiter-ID) hinzufügen möchtest, kannst du  Benutzerfelder verwenden.

Benutzerdefinierte Felder sind eine kostenpflichtige Funktion, die du aktivieren kannst, indem du deinen Arbeitsbereich auf den Pro- oder Enterprise-Abonnementplan aktualisierst.

Benutzer können Daten über das Web, Browser-Erweiterung, iOS, Android und Mac in benutzerdefinierte Felder eingeben.

Für eine umfassende Anleitung zu benutzerdefinierten Feldern sieh dir das Video an und folge den Anweisungen unten.

Die in diesem Video angezeigte Benutzeroberfläche entspricht möglicherweise nicht der aktuellen Version der App.

entspricht möglicherweise nicht der aktuellen Version der App.

Felder erstellen #
------------------

Du kannst benutzerdefinierte Felder in den Einstellungen des Arbeitsbereichs > Registerkarte “Benutzerdefinierte Felder” erstellen. Du kannst bis zu 50 Felder in einem Arbeitsbereich haben.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/custom-field-interface.png)

Wenn du ein Feld erstellst, solltest du den Feldtyp bestimmen:

* **Text** - Eingabefeld, in das du alles, was du möchtest, eingeben kannst (Projekt-ID, zusätzliche Notizen, Koordinaten)
* **Zahl** - Eingabefeld, das ausschließlich numerische Werte akzeptiert
* **Link**- Eingabefeld, das URLs zu Websites oder Dateien (Belege, Screenshots, Dokumente, Aufgabenrefenz) akzeptiert
* **Schalter** - ein einfacher Ja/Nein-Schalter (in Rechnung gestellt, bezahlt, dringend)
* **Wählen** - Eingabefeld, das Benutzern ermöglicht, einzelne Optionen aus einer vordefinierten Liste (Standort, Status, Kategorie) auszuwählen
* **Mehrere auswählen** - Eingabefeld, das Benutzern ermöglicht, jede Anzahl von Werten (verwendete Ausrüstung, Liste für benutzerdefinierte Tags in einem Projekt) aus einer vordefinierten Liste auszuwählen

Du kannst auch reguläre Benutzer verhindern, Daten einzugeben oder zu ändern, indem du **Wer bearbeiten kann: Admins** festlegst (Benutzer können beispielsweise den Status “Unbezahlt/Bezahlt” ansehen


## Chunk 3

n einzugeben oder zu ändern, indem du **Wer bearbeiten kann: Admins** festlegst (Benutzer können beispielsweise den Status “Unbezahlt/Bezahlt” ansehen, aber nur Admins können ihn ändern).

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/custom-fiedl-new.png)

Felder verwenden #
------------------

Damit deine Benutzer die Felder, die du erstellt hast, sehen können, solltest du das Feld in den Slot “Sichtbar” in der Aktiv-Spalte ziehen und ablegen. Danach werden die Felder in “Zeiterfassungssystem” und “Arbeitszeittabelle” für alle im Arbeitsbereich angezeigt.

In einer Arbeitszeittabelle kannst du Daten in zusätzlichen Feldern eingeben, wenn du auf eine Zelle mit Zeitangaben zeigst und die drei Punkte anklickst.

Du kannst bis zu 5 sichtbare Felder für den gesamten Arbeitsbereich haben und 5 weitere in Projekten.

Die Felder funktionieren wie reguläre Eingaben, abhängig vom Feldtyp, den du bestimmst.
Benutzer können Text oder Nummer eingeben, ein Kontrollkästchen markieren oder einen vordefinierten Wert aus der Liste auswählen.

**Wann sollte man unsichtbare Felder verwenden**

Unsichtbare Felder sind nützlich, wenn du Clockify mit externen Systemen über API integrieren möchtest, oder wenn Einträge zusätzliche Metadaten (Projekt-ID oder Projekttyp) aus Projekten erben sollen, aber du willst nicht deine Benutzer mit unwichtigen Daten überfordern.

Wenn du ein Feld aktivi


## Chunk 4

rojekt-ID oder Projekttyp) aus Projekten erben sollen, aber du willst nicht deine Benutzer mit unwichtigen Daten überfordern.

Wenn du ein Feld aktivierst und es unsichtbar machst, können Benutzer das Feld nirgendwo sehen, trotzdem verfügen alle erstellten Einträge über es. Einträge können Werte für unsichtbare Felder über Projekt erben oder du kannst sie über API oder eine Integration aktualisieren.

Die unsichtbaren Felder und ihre Daten werden in Excel- oder CSV-Exporten des Detaillierten Berichts angezeigt.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/custom-field-usage.png)

Felder für Projekte erstellen #
-------------------------------

Zusätzlich zur Aktivierung von benutzerdefinierten Feldern für den gesamten Arbeitsbereich kannst du sie auch nach Projekt aktivieren sowie Sichtbarkeit und einen standardmäßigen Wert in Projekteinstellungen überschreiben.

Alle unsichtbaren Felder werden in Projekten automatisch angezeigt. Du kannst ihren standardmäßigen Wert für ein Projekt festlegen und sie sichtbar (oder unsichtbar) machen, wenn ein Benutzer dieses Projekt wählt.

Du kannst bis zu 10 sichtbare Felder in einem Projekt haben.

Zusätzlich zur Verwaltung von aktiven Feldern kannst du außerdem ein Feld aus der Liste der verfügbaren Felder hinzufügen, damit nur Einträge in diesem bestimmten Projekt das Feld haben.

Möchtest du, dass Felder einen standardmäßigen


## Chunk 5

te der verfügbaren Felder hinzufügen, damit nur Einträge in diesem bestimmten Projekt das Feld haben.

Möchtest du, dass Felder einen standardmäßigen Wert haben, wenn Benutzer ein Projekt wählen? Wenn Benutzer ein Projekt wählen, kann beispielsweise das Feld **Standort** auf **Deutschland** festgelegt und später überschrieben werden, falls es nicht mehr **Deutschland** ist.

Sei vorsichtig mit standardmäßigen Werten, da sie immer vorhandene Werte überschreiben.
*Wenn ein Zeiteintrag beispielsweise **Mein Wert** hat und du ein Projekt mit einem **standardmäßigen Wert** änderst, wird dann **Mein Wert** überschrieben (Du kannst **Mein Wert**  erneut eingeben, aber, wenn du das Projekt des Zeiteintrags wieder änderst, geht **Mein Wert** verloren*.

Projektmanager können die Sichtbarkeit von Feldern überschreiben und einen standardmäßigen Wert für ihre Projekte festlegen.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/custom-field-project.png)

Erweiterte Verwendung #
-----------------------

Du kannst jeden Workflow archivieren, den du benötigst, indem du diese vier Mechanismen verwendest:

* **Berechtigungen bearbeiten** - Du kannst Benutzern ermöglichen, Daten für ihre Zeiteinträge in einem Feld zu bearbeiten, oder die Bearbeitung nur auf Admins begrenzen
* **Sichtbarkeit** - betrifft, ob Benutzer ein Feld im Zeiterfassungssystem oder in einer Arbeitszeittabelle sehen k


## Chunk 6

rbeitung nur auf Admins begrenzen
* **Sichtbarkeit** - betrifft, ob Benutzer ein Feld im Zeiterfassungssystem oder in einer Arbeitszeittabelle sehen können
* **Standardmäßiger Wert** - Felder eines Zeiteintrags sind am Anfang leer, es sei denn, dass du sie mit einem standardmäßigen Wert im Voraus ausfüllst
* **Projektüberschreibungen** - Du kannst die Sichtbarkeit eines Feldes und standardmäßigen Wert nach Projekt überschreiben

Du kannst zum Beispiel ein Feld als von regulären Benutzern nicht bearbeitbar sowie als nur in bestimmten Projekten sichtbar festlegen. Oder du kannst ein Feld unsichtbar machen und einen standardmäßigen Wert in Projekten festlegen, damit jeder Zeiteintrag seine Metadaten im Projekt hat.

| BEARBEITEN | SICHTBARKEIT | STANDARDMÄßIG | ANWENDUNGSFALL |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Jeder | Sichtbar | Leer | **Für Benutzereingabe** Benutzer können ein Eingabefeld sehen und einen Wert (z. B. Kilometerleistung, Ausgaben, Belege) eingeben |
| Jeder | Sichtbar | Erbt | **Für Benutzer zum Überschreiben, wenn nötig** Benutzer können ein Eingabefeld mit vorausgefüllten Werten sehen, die sie, falls nötig, ändern können (z. B. einen anderen Wert wählen) |

| **Administratoren** | Sichtbar | Leer | **Für Benutzer zur Verfolgung des Status** Admins können Zeiteinträge von anderen bearbeiten, damit Benutzer den Status ihrer Zeiteinträge später sehen können |
| **Administratoren** | Sichtbar | Erbt | **Für Benutzerverweis** Einträge zeigen Benutzern Projektinformationen für Refenzzwecke |
| **Administratoren** | Unsichtbar | Leer | **Für Integrationen von Admin** Einträge haben ein Feld mit einem leeren Wert, der nur von Admins über API aktualisiert werden kann |
| **Administratoren** | Unsichtbar | Erbt | **Für Projekt-Metadaten von Admin** Arbeitsbereich oder Projekt-Metadaten, die nur Admins über API überschreiben können (z. B. Name des Arbeitsbereichs, Projekt-ID) |

### Benutzerdefiniertes Pflichtfeld #

Du kannst auch festlegen, dass ein benutzerdefiniertes Feld für jeden Zeiteintrag auf der Arbeitsbereichsebene erforderlich ist.
Um dies zu tun, sollte das benutzerdefinierte Feld eines Zeiteintrags auf **"Sichtbar"** mit einem standardmäßigen Wert festgelegt oder von **"Jeder"** bearbeitet werden. Wenn das benutzerdefinierte Feld richtig konfiguriert wird, wird es in den E


## Chunk 8

m standardmäßigen Wert festgelegt oder von **"Jeder"** bearbeitet werden. Wenn das benutzerdefinierte Feld richtig konfiguriert wird, wird es in den Einstellungen des Arbeitsbereichs, im Abschnitt **"Zeitspeicherung nicht erlauben, ohne"**, in der Registerkarte **"Allgemein"** angezeigt. Nachdem das Feld im Kontrollkästchen markiert wurde, wird es als **Pflichtfeld** im Zeiterfassungssystem und in Arbeitszeittabellen angezeigt.

Also, wenn Benutzer nächstes Mal einen Zeiteintrag eingeben möchten, sollten sie Daten in dieses Pflichtfeld einfügen.

Felder bearbeiten und löschen #
-------------------------------

Das Aktivieren von Feldern betrifft nicht alte Einträge. Nur neue Zeiteinträge, die nach vorne laufen, haben benutzerdefinierte Felder und standardmäßige Werte. Um Zeiteinträgen Felder rückwirkend hinzuzufügen, solltest du Zeiteinträge manuell aktualisieren.

Wenn du ein Feld aus Aktiv nach Verfügbar wechselst, haben neue Einträge nicht das Feld, trotzdem behalten vorhandene Einträge ihre Daten und werden in Exporten angezeigt.

Wenn ein benutzerdefiniertes Feld gelöscht wird, werden das Feld und alle seine Daten aus allen Zeiteinträgen über den gesamten Arbeitsbereich hinweg gelöscht. Wenn ein Feld gelöscht wird, ist es, als ob es nie existiert hätte. Es kann nicht rüc


## Chunk 9

Zeiteinträgen über den gesamten Arbeitsbereich hinweg gelöscht. Wenn ein Feld gelöscht wird, ist es, als ob es nie existiert hätte. Es kann nicht rückgängig gemacht werden. Um Daten zu speichern, ist es am besten, das Feld zu deaktivieren, indem es zur Verfügbar-Spalte verschoben wird.

Wenn du die Optionen des Feldtyps **Wählen** bearbeitest, behalten die vorhandenen Zeiteinträge die Originalwerte. In folgenden Fällen jedoch nicht:

* Wenn du den Wert des Feldtyps **Wählen** im Zeiteintrag in einen anderen Wert manuell änderst
* Wenn du das Projekt des Zeiteintrags in ein Projekt änderst, das einen standardmäßigen Wert für das Feldtyp **Wählen** , erhält der Eintrag den standardmäßigen Wert vom Feldtyp **Wählen** des gewählten Projekts.

### Benutzerdefinierte Felder bearbeiten - Beispiel #

Angenommen, du hast ein benutzerdefiniertes Feld des Feldtyps **Wählen** namens **Standort** mit 3 ausgewählten Optionen: **Berlin**, **München**, und **Köln**.

Du erstellst einen Zeiteintrag und wählst **Berlin** als dein Standort. Dann navigierst du zu Einstellungen des Arbeitsbereichs und benennst die Option **Berlin** in **Köln** um.

Der erstellte Eintrag behält den Wert **Berlin**.

Wenn du den erstellten Eintrag bearbeitest und sein Projekt in ein Projekt änderst, das einen standardmäßigen Wert (z. B. München) als das Feld “Standort” hat, wird **München** ab jetzt als Standort im


## Chunk 10

Projekt in ein Projekt änderst, das einen standardmäßigen Wert (z. B. München) als das Feld “Standort” hat, wird **München** ab jetzt als Standort im Eintrag festgelegt. Anders gesagt, der Originalwert wird jedes Mal, wenn du einen Eintrag aktualisierst, vom standardmäßigen Wert überschrieben.

Ein anderes Beispiel: angenommen, du hast ein Feld namens **Aktualisiert** erstellt, den standardmäßigen Wert auf **2020** festgelegt und es sichtbar gemacht. Deine alten Einträge haben das Feld nicht, aber jeder Eintrag, der nach vorne läuft, wird es haben.

Falls das Projekt in einem alten Zeiteintrag geändert wird, übernimmt dieser Eintrag den Wert **2020** , obwohl er den Wert nie hatte. Auf diese Weise kannst du überprüfen, ob ein Eintrag manipuliert wurde.

Benutzerdefinierte Felder in Berichten #
----------------------------------------

Du kannst Zeiteinträge mit allen ihren Feldern und Daten im Detaillierten Bericht über Excel- oder CSV-Export abrufen. Dann kannst du alle Arten von benutzerdefinierten Berichten in Pivottabellen erstellen.

Du kannst Daten für sichtbare Felder im Detaillierten Bericht direkt ansehen und bearbeiten. Außerdem können Admins Daten aus benutzerdefinierten Feldern bearbeiten, die andere Benutzer eingegeben haben (Reguläre Mitglieder können nur Zeiteinträge bearbeiten und löschen, die zu ihnen gehören).

You can also use Bulk Edit to update Custom field


## Chunk 11

n haben (Reguläre Mitglieder können nur Zeiteinträge bearbeiten und löschen, die zu ihnen gehören).

You can also use Bulk Edit to update Custom fields on multiple time entries with one click.

Der Excel- und CSV-Export listen alle aktiven Felder. Falls Einträge einen Wert in einem benutzerdefinierten Feld haben, das nicht nur im Arbeitsbereich, sondern auch in Projekten nicht mehr aktiv ist, wird das Feld nicht angezeigt.

Beispielsbericht herunterladen (Excel)

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/detailed-report-pivot-custom-fields-3.png)

Außerdem ermöglichen dir die Berichte, einen Bericht nach benutzerdefinierten Feldern zu filtern. Du kannst einfach aktivieren oder deaktivieren, welche Felder du als Filter verwenden möchtest und sie verwenden, wenn du Zeiteinträge filterst.

Die Filter sind benutzerspezifisch. Wenn du ein benutzerdefiniertes Feld zu den Filtern hinzufügst, betrifft das nicht andere. Jeder Benutzer kann seinen eigenen Satz von Filtern haben.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/custom-fields-wr-1024x433.png)

Benutzerdefinierte Felder importieren #
---------------------------------------

Du kannst alle **Aktiven**, **Sichtbaren** und **Unsichtbaren** benutzerdefinierte Pflichtfelder aus einer CSV-Datei importieren. So können Berichte die gesamte erfasste Zeit spezifisch für deinen Anwendungsfall widerspiegeln.

# Benutzerfelder - Clockify-Hilfe


## Chunk 1

Benutzerfelder ermöglichen es dir, zusätzliche Informationen über Teammitglieder (Jobtitel, Startdatum, Stelle, Telefonnummer, Abteilung, Mitarbeiter-ID) hinzuzufügen und sie zusammen mit Zeiteinträgen später zu exportieren.

Das ist eine kostenpflichtige Funktion und sie ist für Benutzer mit dem **Pro-** und **Enterprise**-Abonnementplan verfügbar.

Benutzerfelder erstellen #
--------------------------

Um ein Benutzerfeld zu erstellen, solltest du zu **Einstellungen des Arbeitsbereichs** > **Benutzerdefinierte Felder** gehen, nach unten zum Abschnitt **"Benutzerdefinierte Benutzerfelder"** scrollen und auf **"Erstellen"** klicken.

Zuerst solltest du den Feldtyp aufgrund der Art von Information bestimmen, die du zu einem Benutzer hinzufügen möchtest.

* **Text** - Eingabefeld für jede Art von Information (z. B. Mitarbeiter-ID, Standort, Startdatum)
* **Zahl** - Eingabefeld für Zahlenwerte (z. B. interne ID)
* **Link**- Eingabefeld, das eine URL zu Websites oder Dateien (z. B. Zertifikat, Profil-Link) akzeptiert
* **Schalter** - ein einfacher Schalter für Ja/Nein (z. B. Teilzeit)
* **Wählen** - Eingabefeld, das Benutzern ermöglicht, einzelne Option aus einer vorbestimmten Liste (z. B. Abteilung) auszuwählen
* **Mehrere auswählen** - Eingabefeld, das Benutzern ermöglicht, beliebig viele Werte aus einer vorbestimmten Liste (z. B. Berechtigung) auszuwählen

## Chunk 2

* - Eingabefeld, das Benutzern ermöglicht, beliebig viele Werte aus einer vorbestimmten Liste (z. B. Berechtigung) auszuwählen

Du solltest Name, Beschreibung, Platzhalter ausfüllen und Werte auswählen (falls es welche gibt).

Nachdem du ein Feld erstellt hast, solltest du es in die Aktiv-Spalte ziehen, sodass es in Benutzerprofilen angezeigt wird.

Die maximale Anzahl von erstellten Benutzerfeldern beträgt 50 und die maximale Anzahl von aktiven Benutzerfeldern beträgt 10.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/user-field-new-logo.png)

Benutzerfelder anwenden #
-------------------------

Nachdem ein Benutzerfeld erstellt und aktiviert wurde, solltest du zur Seite “Teams” gehen und auf die drei Punkte neben einem Benutzer klicken.

Wenn du nach unten scrollst, kannst du das Benutzerfeld sehen, das du erstellt hast und den Wert für diesen Benutzer erstellen.

Die Werte für Benutzerfelder können **Besitzer** und **Admins** eingeben.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/define-user-field.png)

Benutzerfelder bearbeiten und löschen #
---------------------------------------

Wenn es einen Wert gibt, der für das Benutzerfeld definiert ist und nachdem das Feld in die Spalte **"Aktive Felder"** gezogen und abgelegt wurde, wird dieser Wert an alle Benutzer im Team (aktive, inaktive und eingeladene) übertragen.

Falls der Standardwert eines **aktiven


## Chunk 3

n und abgelegt wurde, wird dieser Wert an alle Benutzer im Team (aktive, inaktive und eingeladene) übertragen.

Falls der Standardwert eines **aktiven Benutzerfeldes** in einem Moment geändert wird, wird dann der neue Wert nur auf neue Benutzer angewendet (der Standardwert für vorhandene Benutzer wird nicht geändert).

Die Benutzerfelder können zwischen **"Verfügbare Felder"** und **"Aktive Felder"** hin und her gezogen und abgelegt werden.

Wenn man ein Benutzerfeld löscht, werden das Feld und alle seine Daten von allen Mitgliedern über den gesamten Arbeitsbereich hinweg gelöscht. Sobald ein Feld gelöscht wird, ist es so, als ob es nie existiert hätte. Du kannst die Aktion nicht rückgängig machen.

Um Daten zu speichern, solltest du ein benutzerdefiniertes Feld deaktivieren, indem du das Feld zur **Spalte "Verfügbar"** verschiebst.

Benutzerfelder in Berichten #
-----------------------------

Nachdem Benutzer ein Benutzerfeld ausgefüllt haben, kannst du seinen Wert erhalten, wenn du Berichte zusammen mit Zeiteinträgen der Benutzer exportierst.

Um Benutzerfelder im CSV- und Excel-Format zu erhalten, solltest du sie zuerst aktivieren, indem du:

1. Zum **Detaillierten Bericht** gehen
2. Auf **"Exportieren"**  klickst und **"Anpassen"** wählst
3. Felder abhakst, die du im Export erhalten möchtest
4. Export-Einstellungen speicherst

# Benutzerrollen und Zugriffsberechtigungen verstehen - Clockify-Hilfe


## Chunk 1

In Clockify verfügen verschiedene Rollen über bestimmte Berechtigungen, um verschiedene Aufgaben zu erledigen und auf Funktionen zuzugreifen. Das Verständnis von Benutzerrollen und Berechtigungen ist für eine effektive Zusammenarbeit und ein effizientes Workflow-Management entscheidend. In diesem Artikel wird ein Überblick über Benutzerrollen und ihre Zugriffsberechtigungen in Clockify gegeben.

For more information about Admin & owner, Manager and Regular user roles and their access permissions, check out these individual articles.

Bitte beachte, dass CAKE.com-Berechtigungen auch gelten, da CAKE.com als zentrale Organisation fungiert. Weitere Informationen zu CAKE.com-Berechtigungen und welche Wirkung sie auf einzelne Produkte haben, findest du in diesem Artikel.

Rollen #
--------

### Admins & owners  #

Admins and owners have the highest level of access and control within Clockify. They are responsible for managing workspace settings, user permissions, and overall workspace administration.

**Besitzer** haben die höchste Autoritätsebene in der Clockify-App. Als Personen, die einen Arbeitsbereich erstellt haben, verfügen sie über die unvergleichbare Kontrolle über den Arbeitsbereich. Besitzer haben alle Privilegien von Admins, aber verfügen auch über exklusive Rechte, wie das Recht, die Eigentümerschaft an einen anderen Benutzer zu übertragen oder die Einmalanmeldung (SSO)


## Chunk 2

aber verfügen auch über exklusive Rechte, wie das Recht, die Eigentümerschaft an einen anderen Benutzer zu übertragen oder die Einmalanmeldung (SSO) einzurichten. Dazu sind Besitzer die einzigen, die das Löschen eines Arbeitsbereichs initiieren können, wenn sie ihn verlassen oder ihr Konto löschen.

**Admins** haben wesentliche Kontrolle und Autorität in der Clockify-App. Sie sind für die Verwaltung von Arbeitsbereichseinstellungen, Benutzerberechtigungen und die gesamte Arbeitsbereichverwaltung verantwortlich. Admins können Projekte erstellen und verwalten, Benutzerrollen zuweisen und Abrechnungssätze bestimmen.

### Manager #

Es gibt zwei Typen von Managern in Clockify:

* **Projektmanager**
* **Teammanager**

Die Managerrolle ist eine kostenpflichtige Funktion, die du aktivieren kannst, indem du deinen Arbeitsbereich auf den Standard-, Pro- oder Enterprise-Abonnementplan aktualisierst.

**Projektmanager** können erfasste Zeit für ihre Projekte sehen, Projektdetails verwalten, einen Kiosk starten, falls aktiviert, und eingereichte Arbeitszeittabellen genehmigen.

**Teammanager** können andererseits die gesamte erfasste Zeit für ihre Teammitglieder sehen, die Zeiten ihres Teams bearbeiten, falls diese Funktion aktiviert ist und eingereichte Arbeitszeittabellen genehmigen.

### Reguläre Benutzer #

Reguläre Benutzer verfügen über eingeschränkte Berechtigungen im Vergleich zu


## Chunk 3

eingereichte Arbeitszeittabellen genehmigen.

### Reguläre Benutzer #

Reguläre Benutzer verfügen über eingeschränkte Berechtigungen im Vergleich zu Admins und Managern. Sie können Zeit erfassen, eigene Zeiteinträge oder die von anderen sehen und grundlegende projektbezogene Aufgaben ausführen, wie Aufgaben erstellen und bearbeiten. Reguläre Benutzer können auch andere Mitglieder im Arbeitsbereich sehen und an Projekten teilnehmen, die ihnen zugewiesen werden.

Aktionen #
----------

* **Zeit erfassen**
  Regular users can track time on public and private projects, while managers,\* admins and owners have access to projects.

# Berichte anpassen - Clockify-Hilfe


## Chunk 1

Wenn die in Clockify integrierten Berichte und Optionen für die Anpassung nicht die von dir benötigte Struktur bieten, kannst du deinen eigenen Bericht mithilfe von Pivot-Tabellen in Excel/Google Sheets erstellen.

Du kannst die detaillierten Berichte einfach als CSV- oder Excel-Datei exportieren, und jede Art von Bericht erstellen, die du möchtest:

* Gesamtstunden (oder Betrag) aufgeschlüsselt nach Kunde > Projekt > Aufgabe > Beschreibung
* Monatlicher Bericht mit Gesamtstunden (oder Betrag) pro Projekt (oder Benutzer) pro Tag

Beispiel ansehen (Google Sheets)

Benutzerdefinierten Bericht erstellen #
---------------------------------------

So kannst du einen benutzerdefinierten Bericht erstellen:

1. Den detaillierten Bericht von Clockify in CSV oder Excel exportieren und ihn in Google Sheets oder Excel öffnen
2. Die gesamte Tabelle auswählen
3. Excel: zu Einfügen > Pivot-Tabelle gehen; Google Sheets: zu Einfügen > Pivot-Tabelle gehen
4. Auf "OK" klicken
5. Schließlich wählt man, welche Felder in Zeilen/Spalten angezeigt werden sollen und was als Werte angezeigt werden soll. Beispiel: "Zeile: Projekt", "Spalte: Benutzer", "Wert: Dauer (dezimal)"

Zusätzliche Daten #
-------------------

Du kannst Berichte mit benutzerdefinierten Felder bei Zeiteinträgen erweitern. Deine Benutzer können alle möglichen Dinge erfassen, wie Ausgaben, Kilometerleistung, Einheiten usw.

Du kannst

Überschneidende Einträge #
--------------------------

Wenn du Einträge mit sich überschneidenden Start- und Endzeiten hast, kannst du diese leicht in Excel oder Google Sheets finden.

1. Den detaillierten Bericht von Clockify in CSV exportieren
2. CSV-Datei in Excel/Google Sheets öffnen
3. Alle Daten auswählen und sie nach: Benutzer>Startdatum>Startzeit sortieren
4. Eine neue **Überlappungsspalte** erstellen
5. Für den ersten Datensatz verwendest du diese Formel: =IF(OR(IF($F1=$F2, IF($I2=$I1, IF($L1>$J2, true, false))),IF($F2=$F3, IF($I2=$I3, IF($L2>$J3, true, false)))), "overlap", "ok")
6. Die Formel erweitern und sie für jede Zeile anwenden
7. Bedingte Formatierung anwenden, um sich überschneidende Zeiteinträge hervorzuheben
8. Pivot-Tabelle auf der Grundlage der Daten in der Tabelle erstellen
9. In der Pivot-Tabelle auswählen: **Zeile:Überschneidung,**, **Wert:Überschneid


## Chunk 3

8. Pivot-Tabelle auf der Grundlage der Daten in der Tabelle erstellen
9. In der Pivot-Tabelle auswählen: **Zeile:Überschneidung,**, **Wert:Überschneidung (Anzahl)**
10. Auf die Anzahl der Überschneidungen klicken, um nur die überschneidenden Einträge in einer neuen Tabelle zu sehen

So funktioniert die Formel: Sobald alle Einträge sortiert sind, vergleicht die Formel die vorherige und die nächste Zeile. Wenn die Zeilen vom gleichen Benutzer und vom gleichen Datum stammen, wird geprüft, ob sich die Startzeit des Eintrags mit der Endzeit des vorherigen Eintrags überschneidet oder ob sich die Endzeit mit der Startzeit des nächsten Eintrags überschneidet.

# Berichte exportieren - Clockify-Hilfe


## Chunk 1

Du kannst Daten exportieren und Berichte im PDF-, CSV- und Excel-Format herunterladen und diese dann den Export an deinen Buchhalter/deine Lohnbuchhaltung senden, als persönliche Datensicherung aufbewahren oder Daten in eine Tabellenkalkulation importieren und die Ergebnisse analysieren. Die exportierte Datei kann die folgenden Zeiteintragsdetails enthalten: Projekt, Kunde, Beschreibung, Aufgabe, Benutzer, E-Mail, Tags, abrechenbarer Status, Startdatum, Startzeit, Enddatum, Endzeit, Dauer (einschließlich Nacht), abrechenbarer Satz, abrechenbarer Betrag.
Eine PDF-Datei kann bis zu 3000 Reihen enthalten.

Diese Funktion ist kostenlos und in allen Plänen verfügbar.

**Um einen vollständigen Export (mit allen Zeiteinträgen zu erhalten**), solltest du zu Detaillierten Bericht gehen, den längsten Datumsbereich auswählen und die Ergebnisse exportieren. Du kannst diese Datei für ein persönliches Backup oder zum
Importieren von Einträgen in einen anderen Clockify-Arbeitsbereich oder eine andere App verwenden.

Bericht exportieren #
---------------------

**Um einen Bericht zu exportieren,** solltest du:

1. Zum Bericht gehen, den du exportieren möchtest
2. Auf "Exportieren" klicken
3. Format auswählen und der Bericht wird automatisch auf deinem Computer gespeichert sein

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-20-at-15.19.57-1024x449.png)

Es werden nur die Daten exportiert, die im Bericht enthalten sind. Wenn du also Filter angewendet hast, wird der Export nur gefilterte Daten enthalten.

**Die Gruppierungsoptionen** im Zusammenfassungsbericht wirken sich darauf aus, wie deine Exporte aussehen. Wenn du z. B. nach Benutzer gruppierst und nach Beschreibung in Untergruppen aufteilst, werden die Daten auch im Export auf diese Weise gruppiert.

**Der Export des Zusammenfassungsberichts enthält keine Zeitstempel**. Wenn du Zeitstempel benötigst, solltest du den detaillierten Bericht exportieren.

**Wenn du die Zeit ohne abrechenbare Daten exportieren möchtest,** kannst du auf **"Betrag anzeigen"** klicken und **"Betrag ausblenden"** auswählen.

Bitte beachte, wenn du ein Tag aus einem Arbeitsbereich, der im Namen Kommas enthält, exportierst und diese Datei exportierst, erhältst du zwei Tags anstelle eines. Das passiert, weil du ein Komma im Tagnamen verwendet hast.

Zum Beispiel:

1. *Tag **Müller, Peter** erstellen*
2. Bericht, der dieses Tag enthält, im CSV-Format exportieren
3. Die CSV-Datei wieder importieren

*Es werden zwei Tags erstellt, ein Tag für Peter, das andere für Müller.*

Um genau die Zeiteinträge zu sehen, die du in einem Bericht benötigst, kannst du Datumsbereiche und Filter verwenden.

Datumsbereiche #
----------------

Wenn du sehen möchtest, woran du und dein Team in einem bestimmten Zeitraum gearbeitet habt:

1. Zu einem beliebigen Bericht gehen
2. Klicke auf **"Diese Woche"** in der oberen rechten Ecke
3. Das Startdatum aus dem linken Kalender und das Enddatum aus dem rechten Kalender wählen

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/new-filter-copy.png)

Du kannst auch schnell eine der vordefinierten Optionen auswählen (Heute/Gestern, Diese/Letzte Woche, Die letzten zwei Wochen, Dieser/Letzter Monat und Dieses/Letztes Jahr).

Du kannst auf klicken, um die Einträge der vorherigen oder nächsten Woche/Monat/Jahr zu sehen.

Nur Benutzer mit kostenpflichtigen Abonnementplänen können auf Daten für Datumsbereiche zugreifen, die länger als ein Jahr sind.

Filter #

Du kannst auch nach fehlenden Daten filtern und Einträge ohne Kunde, Projekt, Aufgabe oder Tag suchen.

Wenn du benutzerdefinierte Felder verwendest, kannst du in der Dropdownliste **"Filter"** klicken und die Filter für die benutzerdefinierten Felder aktivieren, die du benötigst (oder die regulären Filter deaktivieren, die du nicht verwendest).

Du kannst Zeiteinträge auch nach der Beschreibung filtern. Zum Beispiel kannst du "Überstundenberichte aktualisieren" eingeben, um nach dem Zeiteintrag "Überstundenberichte aktualisieren" zu suchen.

Um einen Filter zu entfernen, solltest du auf **"Filter löschen"**  klicken.

Du kannst Berichte mithilfe von drei Mechanismen nach Tags filtern:

* Enthält - der Bericht listet alle Zeiteinträge auf, die das ausgewählte Tag haben
* Enthält nicht - der Bericht schließt alle Zeiteinträge aus, die das ausgewählte Tag haben
* Enthält nur - der Bericht listet nur Zeiteinträge auf, die alle ausgewählten Tags enthalten

Wenn du einen Bericht filterst oder freigibst, kannst du für ihn auch angeben, ob er dir oder jemand anderem in deinem Konto gesendet werden soll, damit sie die neuesten Informationen über Zeiterfassung für diesen oder vorigen Tag, Woche oder Monat immer erhalten.

Nur Besitzer und Admins können die geplanten Berichte erstellen.

Die geplanten Berichte sind eine kostenpflichtige Funktion, die du aktivieren kannst, indem du deinen Arbeitsbereich auf den Pro- oder Enterprise-Abonnementplan aktualisierst.

Schritte zum Planen des Berichts #
----------------------------------

So kannst du einen Bericht planen:

1. Zu einem beliebigen Bericht gehen
2. Notwendige Filter anwenden, die der Bericht haben soll (z B. nach Benutzern, Kunden usw. filtern)
3. Einen relativen Zeitraum auswählen (z. B. diese Woche, letzter Monat, usw.)
4. Auf das Symbol “Freigeben” klicken
5. Den Berichte benennen (dieser Name wird in E-Mails, auf Seiten im Bericht und in Exporten benutzt)
6. Einen Empfänger auswählen
7. Auswählen, wie oft du den Bericht erhalten willst (täglich, wöchentlich oder monatlich)
8. Auf **"Link erstellen"** klicken

Die Berichte mit angepassten Datumsbereichen können nicht geplant werden und nur Admins können Berichte planen.

Du kannst alle deine geplanten Berichte auf der Seite “Geteilte Berichte” ansehen. Neben Berichten, die an E-Mail gesendet werden, steht das Tag **"Geplant"**.

Du kannst die Planung für vorhandene geteilte Berichte auf der Seite "Geteilte Berichte” ein-/ausschalten, indem du auf die drei Punkte neben einem Bericht klickst.

Admins können auswählen, dass ein Bericht nur an sie gesendet wird, oder andere Benutzer in ihrem Arbeitsbereich wählen.

Geplante Berichte per E-Mail erhalten #
---------------------------------------

* **Tägliche** E-Mails werden jeden Tag gemäß der Einstellung des Empfängers für den **Tagesstart** in
  Profileinstellungen gesendet
* **Wöchentliche** E-Mails werden am Anfang jeder Woche gemäß dem Wochenstart des Empfängers in Einstellungen des Arbeitsbereichs und dem Tagesstart in Profileinstellungen gesendet
* **Monatliche** E-Mails werden am Monatsersten und gemäß der Einstellung für den **Tagesstart** in Profileinstellungen gesendet

### E-Mail-Inhalt #

* Name des Berichts
* Genaue Daten, für die der Bericht gesendet wird
* Die gesamte erfasste Zeit und wie viel davon abrechenbar ist (dies wird im Moment des Sendens von E-Mails berechnet). Falls du willst, dass in der E-Mail die abrechenbare Zeit nicht an


## Chunk 3

viel davon abrechenbar ist (dies wird im Moment des Sendens von E-Mails berechnet). Falls du willst, dass in der E-Mail die abrechenbare Zeit nicht angezeigt wird, solltest du sicherstellen, dass **“Betrag nicht anzeigen”** gewählt wird, bevor du den Bericht teilst.
* Link zum Live-Zeitbericht für weitere Informationen (der relative Datumsbereich, den du gespeichert hast, wird immer angezeigt)
* Direkte Links, um den Bericht im PDF-, CSV- und Excel-Format herunterzuladen (der Download ist für die Daten aus der E-Mail)

Wenn es eine neue Summe gibt, da du Arbeitszeittabellen hinzugefügt oder vorhandene bearbeitet hast, enthält die E-Mail veraltete Informationen, aber der Link zeigt aktuelle Informationen an.

Hast du die Informationen im Bericht gesperrt, berücksichtigen die Download-Links aus der E-Mail die gesperrten Daten (z. B. wenn du **"Gestern"** gespeichert und das Datum gesperrt hast, führt dich jede frühere E-Mail zum gleichen Download, z. B. von gestern).

### E-Mail-Berichte an Mitarbeiter außerhalb Clockify senden #

Wenn du willst, dass andere Mitarbeiter geplante Berichte erhalten, solltest du die Weiterleitung von E-Mails einrichten.

Du solltest einen Filter für die E-Mails in deinem E-Mail-Kunden erstellen, die den nötigen Betreff enthalten und dann die Regel erstellen, dass die E-M


## Chunk 4

solltest einen Filter für die E-Mails in deinem E-Mail-Kunden erstellen, die den nötigen Betreff enthalten und dann die Regel erstellen, dass die E-Mails an eine andere E-Mail weitergeleitet werden.

Du kannst beispielsweise einen Bericht nach einem Kunden filtern, den Bericht **KundeX Wochenbericht** nennen und ihn so einplanen, dass er einmal pro Woche gesendet wird und dann einen Filter und eine Regel für diese E-Mails so erstellen, dass sie aus deinem Posteingang an die E-Mail-Adresse deines Kunden automatisch gesendet werden.

So wird die Weiterleitung von E-Mails für: Gmail / Outlook / Mail (Mac) eingerichtet.

# Berichte teilen - Clockify-Hilfe


## Chunk 1

Wenn du deinen Bericht mit anderen teilen möchtest, kannst du einen privaten Link zu dem Bericht an andere senden, damit diese in Echtzeit auf die Daten zugreifen können, auch wenn sie kein Clockify-Konto haben.

Diese Funktion ist **kostenlos** und für alle Abonnementpläne verfügbar.

Berichte teilen #
-----------------

1. Bericht anpassen (Filter, Datumsbereich wählen, gruppieren, sortieren, runden, Betrag anzeigen/ausblenden)
2. Auf das Symbol "Teilen" klicken (zwischen Drucken und Rundung)
3. Einen Berichtsnamen eingeben (dieser wird als Titel des Berichts in der Kopfzeile und beim PDF-Export angezeigt)
4. Dann auswählen, wer den Link öffnen kann (öffentlich/privat) und ob der Datumsbereich geändert werden kann (Daten sperren)
5. Auf **"Link erstellen"** klicken
6. Den Link kopieren und ihn an andere senden

**Die Option "Daten sperren"** verhindert, dass Betrachter deinen freigegebenen Bericht für verschiedene Datumsbereiche sehen können. Diese Option ist standardmäßig deaktiviert, sodass die Betrachter verschiedene Datumsbereiche durchgehen können, wenn sie den Bericht ansehen.

Wenn du anstelle eines benutzerdefinierten Datumsbereichs einen relativen Datumsbereich wählst (z. B. Diese Woche, Letzter Monat usw.), erhältst du auch **die Option "Immer öffnen als..."** Das bedeutet, dass der Bericht beim Öffnen immer für den letzten oder aktuellen Tag, die aktuelle Woche ode


## Chunk 2

auch **die Option "Immer öffnen als..."** Das bedeutet, dass der Bericht beim Öffnen immer für den letzten oder aktuellen Tag, die aktuelle Woche oder den aktuellen Monat angezeigt wird (was du je nach den Einstellungen der Option "Daten sperren" ändern kannst).

Wenn du z. B. einen Bericht für **den letzten Monat** im Mai anzeigst, erhältst du beim Klicken auf **Teilen** die Option **"Immer öffnen als..."** , die standardmäßig aktiviert ist. Wenn du diese Option deaktivierst, wird der Bericht beim Öffnen immer Mai anzeigen.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image_1-3.png)

Überblick über geteilte Berichte #
----------------------------------

Auf der Registerkarte **"Geteilt"** kannst du auf alle Berichte zugreifen, die du erstellt hast oder die jemand mit dir geteilt hat.

Jeden Bericht, den du erstellt hast, kannst du über das Feld **"Nach Namen suchen"** oben auf der Seite durchsuchen oder bearbeiten und löschen, indem du auf die drei Punkte klickst und die entsprechende Option wählst (Details zum Freigeben bearbeiten, löschen) oder siehst, welche Filter in einem Bericht angewendet werden.

Geteilte Berichte spiegeln immer die aktuellen Berechtigungen (welche Daten sie sehen können) und Einstellungen (ihre Zeitzone und den Wochenanfang zum Zeitpunkt der Erstellung) des Erstellers wider.

Wenn du z. B. ein Administrator bist und einen Link zu einem Be

hre Zeitzone und den Wochenanfang zum Zeitpunkt der Erstellung) des Erstellers wider.

Wenn du z. B. ein Administrator bist und einen Link zu einem Bericht erstellst, in dem du die abrechenbaren Beträge und alle Zeiteinträge sehen kannst, aber später ein regulärer Benutzer wirst, wird der Link zu dem Bericht nicht mehr funktionieren, da du als Ersteller des Links keinen Zugriff mehr auf diese Informationen hast. Außerdem können Administratoren alle **öffentlich** geteilten Berichte sehen, auch wenn sie nicht direkt für sie freigegeben sind.

Auf der Seite "Geteilte Berichte" werden die Links angezeigt, die du selbst erstellt hast, sowie die Links, die andere Nutzer mit dir geteilt haben. Zusätzlich dazu kannst du die Liste der Benutzer sehen, mit denen du Berichte teilen kannst.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-20-at-15.22.58-1024x263.png)

Sobald ein geteilter Bericht gelöscht wird, wird der Link inaktiv und der Browser zeigt eine leere Seite an.

Berichte planen #
-----------------

Du kannst einen geteilten Bericht planen und ihn jeden Tag, jede Woche oder jeden Monat in deinem Posteingang erhalten.

Berechtigungen #

# Berichte und Rechnungen stimmen nicht überein - Clockify-Hilfe


## Chunk 1

Wenn du kleine Unterschiede zwischen den Beträgen in deinen Berichten und Rechnungen feststellst, handelt es sich nicht um einen Fehler. Dies liegt daran, dass Clockify die Beträge auf leicht unterschiedliche Weise berechnet, um die Genauigkeit zu wahren.

Berichte berechnen die Zeit mit mehr Dezimalstellen als Rechnungen #
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Clockify erfasst die Zeit mit mehreren Dezimalstellen, zum Beispiel 1,375 Stunden.

* Berichte zeigen die Zeit im vollständigen Format an (sofern nicht in den Arbeitsbereichseinstellungen geändert), z. B. 1:15:45 oder 1 Stunde, 15 Minuten und 45 Sekunden.
* Rechnungen hingegen wandeln die Zeit um und runden sie auf zwei Dezimalstellen, zum Beispiel 1,26 Stunden.

Diese unterschiedliche Behandlung der Zeit führt zu geringfügigen Abweichungen in der Gesamtsumme.

Rechnungen runden jeden Eintrag, bevor die Gesamtsummen berechnet werden #
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Beim Erstellen einer Rechnung rundet Clockify jeden Zeiteintrag auf 2 Dezimalstellen, bevor er mit dem Stundensatz multipliziert wird. Berichte berechnen zuerst die Gesamtzeit und multiplizieren dann.

**Beispiel:**

Du hast drei Einträge erfasst:

* Eintrag 1: 1:15:45
* Eintrag 2: 2:45:30
* Eintrag 3: 0:59:50

Berichtssummen:

* Gesamtzeit = 5:01:05 (5 Stunden, 1 Minute, 5 Sekunden)


## Chunk 2

e erfasst:

* Eintrag 1: 1:15:45
* Eintrag 2: 2:45:30
* Eintrag 3: 0:59:50

Berichtssummen:

* Gesamtzeit = 5:01:05 (5 Stunden, 1 Minute, 5 Sekunden)
* Bei 100 $/h -> 501,08 $

Rechnungssummen:

* Eintrag 1: 1:15:45 -> 1,26 h
* Eintrag 2: 2:45:30 -> 2,76 h
* Eintrag 3: 0:59:50 -> 1,00 h
* Gesamt = 1,26 + 2,76 + 1,00 = 5,02 h
* Bei 100 $/h -> 502,00

Die Rechnung weist am Ende 502,00 aus, während der Bericht 501,08 zeigt,was eine Differenz von 0,92 durch die Rundung der Umrechnung ergibt.

So stimmen Rechnungen und Berichte überein #
--------------------------------------------

Damit beide Funktionen die Zeit auf die gleiche Weise berechnen, aktiviere die Zeitrundung für alle Zeiteinträge.

Beste Option:

* Stelle die Rundung auf die nächsten 6 Minuten ein (was 0,1 Stunden entspricht).

Clockify verwendet 0,1 Stunden = 6 Minuten als Rundungsbasis. Da sowohl Berichte als auch Rechnungen jeden Zeiteintrag auf die gleiche Weise auf den nächsten 6-Minuten-Block runden, erhältst du konsistente Ergebnisse.

**Beispiel:**

Nehmen wir an, du hast diesen Zeiteintrag:

* Tatsächlich erfasste Zeit: 1:07:00 = 1,1166... Stunden

Ohne Rundung:

* Bericht verwendet 1,1166 h -> 111,66
* Rechnung rundet:1,12h−>112,00

0,34 $ Differenz

Mit der Rundung auf die nächsten sechs Minuten:

* 1:07:00 wird auf 1,1 h gerundet (da 6 Minuten = 0,1 h)
* Sowohl der Bericht als auch die Rechnung verwenden 1,


## Chunk 3

dung auf die nächsten sechs Minuten:

* 1:07:00 wird auf 1,1 h gerundet (da 6 Minuten = 0,1 h)
* Sowohl der Bericht als auch die Rechnung verwenden 1,1 h -> 110,00 $

Durch das Runden auf eine durch 6 teilbare Zahl landen alle Einträge auf derselben Zeiteinheit (z. B. 1,0h, 1,1h, 1,2h usw.), wodurch alle Sekunden, die zu Diskrepanzen führen, entfernt werden.

So aktivierst du die Zeitrundung #
----------------------------------

1. Klicke auf die drei Punkte neben dem Arbeitsbereichsnamen
2. Wähle **Arbeitsbereichseinstellungen**
3. Scrolle nach unten und navigiere zum Abschnitt **Zeitrundung**
4. Wähle **Auf 6 Minuten aufrunden**

# Berichte verstehen und verwenden - Clockify-Hilfe


## Chunk 1

Dieser Leitfaden erklärt regulären Benutzern, wie sie ihre Zeiterfassungsberichte in Clockify ansehen, interpretieren und filtern können. Du wirst lernen, wie du auf verschiedene Berichtstypen zugreifst, nach bestimmten Kriterien wie Datum, Projekt oder Kunde filterst und Berichte an deine Bedürfnisse anpasst.

Berichtsübersicht #
-------------------

Clockify bietet verschiedene Arten von Berichten an, um dir bei der Zeiterfassung und den Ausgaben zu helfen:

* **Zusammenfassungsbericht**Dieser Bericht fasst deine Zeiteinträge nach verschiedenen Kriterien wie Projekt, Kunde, Benutzer, Tag oder Datum zusammen. Es ist ideal, um einen Überblick über deine Zeiteinträge in einem bestimmten Zeitraum zu erhalten.
* **Detaillierter Bericht**Dieser Bericht zeigt alle Details deiner Zeiteinträge, ohne sie zu gruppieren oder zusammenzufassen. Er liefert eine Aufschlüsselung jedes Zeiteintrags Zeile für Zeile.
* **Wöchentlicher Bericht**Der wöchentliche Bericht ist ideal für die wöchentliche Zeiterfassung, da er die Zeiteinträge nach Benutzer oder Projekt innerhalb eines festen Wochenbereichs gruppiert anzeigt.

Durch Berichte navigieren #
---------------------------

So greifst du auf den Berichtsabschnitt zu und navigierst durch ihn:

1. Gehe in der Seitenleiste zur Seite **Berichte**Wenn die Seite **Berichte** nicht sichtbar ist, könnte sie durch deine Arbeitsbereichs-Admins eingeschrä


## Chunk 2

ehe in der Seitenleiste zur Seite **Berichte**Wenn die Seite **Berichte** nicht sichtbar ist, könnte sie durch deine Arbeitsbereichs-Admins eingeschränkt sein.
2. Wähle zwischen dem **zusammenfassenden**, **detaillierten** oder **wöchentlichen** Bericht, je nachdem, was du brauchst.

Berichte filtern #
------------------

Clockify ermöglicht dir, deine Berichte nach verschiedenen Kriterien zu filtern, um genau die Daten zu erhalten, die du brauchst. So filterst du deine Berichte:

1. Wähle einen Zeitraum
   Oben auf der Seite **Berichte** wählst du den **Kalenderdatumsbereich** für den Bericht aus. Du kannst benutzerdefinierte Datumsbereiche oder vordefinierte Optionen wie "letzte Woche" oder "diesen Monat" wählen.
2. Nach Projekt, Kunde oder Benutzer filtern
   **Projekt**: Filter nach aktiven oder archivierten Projekten
   **Kunde**: Filter nach aktiven oder archivierten Kunden
   **Benutzer**: Filter nach bestimmten Teammitgliedern oder zeige alle Benutzer (aktive/inaktive) an
3. Nach Eintragsstatus, Tag oder Aufgabe filtern Du kannst Zeiteinträge nach **Status** (genehmigt, ausstehend, etc.), **Beschreibung**, **Tag** oder **Aufgabe** filtern, um eine detailliertere Ansicht der erfassten Zeit zu erhalten.

Berichtsdaten #
---------------

Sobald du die relevanten Filter angewendet hast, zeigt der Bericht die folgenden wichtigen Datenpunkte an:

1. **Gesamte geleistete Zeit*


## Chunk 3

-----------

Sobald du die relevanten Filter angewendet hast, zeigt der Bericht die folgenden wichtigen Datenpunkte an:

1. **Gesamte geleistete Zeit**
   Dies ist die gesamte in dem ausgewählten Zeitraum erfasste Zeit. Sie umfasst sowohl abrechenbare als auch nicht abrechenbare Stunden.
2. **Abrechenbare Stunden**
   Abrechenbare Stunden sind Zeiteinträge, die einem Kunden oder Projekt in Rechnung gestellt werden können. Diese werden im Bericht von den nicht abrechenbaren Stunden getrennt aufgeführt.
3. **Projektzusammenfassungen**Wenn du deinen Bericht nach Projekten gruppierst, siehst du eine Aufschlüsselung der insgesamt für jedes Projekt erfassten Zeit. Dies ist nützlich, um zu verstehen, wie viel Zeit für jedes Projekt aufgewendet wurde.
4. **Gesamtbetrag**
   Für abrechenbare Stunden zeigt der Bericht auch den gesamten Geldwert an, der auf dem für jedes Projekt oder jeden Kunden festgelegten Stundensatz basiert.

Berichte anpassen und exportieren #
-----------------------------------

Clockify bietet dir eine Vielzahl von Optionen, um deine Berichte anzupassen und zu exportieren:

1. Bericht für den Export anpassen
   Du kannst die Filter und Gruppierungen anpassen, um einen Bericht zu erstellen, der genau auf deine Bedürfnisse zugeschnitten ist, egal ob du eine Zusammenfassung, eine detaillierte Aufschlüsselung oder eine wöchentliche Übersicht benötigst.
2. Bericht in e


## Chunk 4

isse zugeschnitten ist, egal ob du eine Zusammenfassung, eine detaillierte Aufschlüsselung oder eine wöchentliche Übersicht benötigst.
2. Bericht in einem der Formate exportieren (PDF, Excel oder CSV)
3. Bericht speichern

Für präzisere Berichte kannst du die Rundung für die Zeiteinträge im Bericht aktivieren oder deaktivieren, wenn die in Minuten erfasste Zeit auf die nächste volle Zahl auf- oder abgerundet werden soll.

Häufig gestellte Fragen (FAQ) #
-------------------------------

### Kann ich den Datumsbereich für die Berichte anpassen? #

Ja, du kannst den Datumsbereich für jeden Bericht über die **Kalender**-Option oben rechts auf der Seite anpassen.

### Wie sehe ich abrechenbare Stunden in den Berichten? #

Im **Zusammenfassenden Bericht** und **Detaillierten Bericht** siehst du die **abrechenbaren Stunden** für jeden Eintrag. Abrechenbare Stunden werden getrennt von den nicht abrechenbaren Stunden angezeigt, damit du leicht verfolgen kannst, welche Zeiteinträge in Rechnung gestellt werden können.

Verwende den Filterbereich des Berichts, um nach **Aufgabe**, **Tag** oder **Eintragsstatus** zu filtern. So kannst du die Daten eingrenzen und dir nur bestimmte Aufgaben oder Einträge anzeigen lassen, die mit einem bestimmten Tag versehen sind.

Suivi du temps #
----------------

Tout dans Clockify tourne autour des saisies de temps. Vous suivez le temps que vous passez à travailler sur des choses et vous analysez ensuite les semaines de travail dans des rapports. Clockify vous permet également d’inviter d’autres personnes, afin que vous puissiez suivre et analyser le temps ensemble.

Il y a plusieurs façons de créer des saisies de temps dans Clockify :

* **En utilisant un minuteur, pendant que vous travaillez**
  Lorsque vous commencez à travailler, tapez ce sur quoi vous travaillez et lance


## Chunk 2

ckify :

* **En utilisant un minuteur, pendant que vous travaillez**
  Lorsque vous commencez à travailler, tapez ce sur quoi vous travaillez et lancez un minuteur. Lorsque vous avez terminé, arrêtez le minuteur et la saisie de temps est ajoutée automatiquement à votre feuille de temps.
* **En ajoutant manuellement du temps, une fois que vous avez terminé**
  Si vous ne voulez pas vous embêter avec le minuteur (ou si vous avez oublié de le lancer), vous pouvez ajouter manuellement des saisies de temps après coup. Il suffit de taper ce sur quoi vous avez travaillé, de choisir le début et/ou la durée, et d’ajouter la saisie de temps. Vous pouvez également créer des saisies via le calendrier.
* **En ajoutant via le suivi automatisé**
  Si vous avez besoin de précision mais que vous oubliez de démarrer et d'arrêter le minuteur, activez le suivi automatisé. Ensuite, à la fin de la journée, passez en revue toutes les activités enregistrées (p. ex. les applis et les sites Web que vous avez utilisés) et créez des saisies de temps à partir de celles-ci.

# Billing tracked time - Clockify Help


## Chunk 1

Billing tracked time
====================

Ao cobrar por hora, é vital que acompanhe o tempo gasto em tarefas relacionadas ao trabalho para saber o quanto precisa cobrar de cada cliente.

Além de rastrear as horas faturáveis, você também deve rastrear o tempo não faturável (por exemplo, lendo e respondendo e-mails, chamadas do Skype, preparação de faturas, etc.). Você não consegue ter um verdadeiro controle da sua situação financeira se não souber quanto tempo realmente gasta em tarefas.

O Clockify ajuda você a ver quanta atividade faturável e não faturável você faz e como isso afeta seus ganhos.

A interface do usuário exibida neste vídeo pode não corresponder à versão mais recente do aplicativo.

Digamos que você tenha um novo cliente e queira rastrear suas taxas faturáveis.

Veja como seria seu fluxo de trabalho Clockify:

Definir projetos #
------------------

1. Defina uma taxa faturável para cada pessoa na seção Equipe e uma taxa faturável padrão nas Configurações do espaço de trabalho.
2. Adicionar um cliente na página Clientes
3. Crie um novo projeto na seção Projetos e selecione o cliente. Se desejar, você também pode configurar:
   * Tarefas, para que você possa selecioná-las ao rastrear o tempo e depois agrupar as entradas de tempo por tarefas nos relatórios
   * Estimativas, para que você possa comparar o tempo estimado com o tempo rastreado em projetos e o orçamen


## Chunk 2

adas de tempo por tarefas nos relatórios
   * Estimativas, para que você possa comparar o tempo estimado com o tempo rastreado em projetos e o orçamento com a quantia gasta.
   * Project and task billable rates, so Clockify can use a different billable rate when calculating how much you’ve earned on that particular project or task

Rastrear o tempo #
------------------

1. Comece a rastrear o tempo quando começar a trabalhar: digite no que está trabalhando, selecione o projeto, clique em $ para marcar o tempo como faturável e inicie o cronômetro
2. Pare o cronômetro quando parar de trabalhar e o tempo será adicionado à sua planilha.
3. Ao continuar trabalhando em algo, pressione o ícone de reprodução ao lado da entrada de tempo apropriada para iniciar o cronômetro para essa atividade novamente.
4. Quando estiver em uma reunião com o cliente, inicie o cronômetro, digite “Reunião”, selecione o projeto e marque o horário como não faturável. Ao rastrear o tempo não faturável, você terá uma imagem mais realista de quanto tempo realmente gasta com o cliente (e não apenas o tempo pelo qual é pago). Você também pode adicionar uma etiqueta de **reunião** para filtrar as entradas de tempo por etiquetas em Relatórios.

Veja o detalhamento do tempo nos relatórios #

## Chunk 3

tempo nos relatórios #
---------------------------------------------

1. Quando chegar a hora de faturar seu cliente no final do mês, vá para o Relatório resumido, selecione **Este mês**, o projeto (ou apenas o cliente se você quiser faturar por vários projetos que você faz para eles), mostre apenas o tempo faturável registrado e clique em  **Filtrar** para ver as entradas de tempo que você precisa faturar.
2. Agrupe por projeto e subgrupo por entrada de horas para tornar mais útil a divisão de dados.
3. Exporte o relatório com uma divisão de tempo detalhada em PDF e envie-o ao seu cliente para revisão.
4. Quando estiver em uma reunião com o cliente, inicie o cronômetro, digite “Reunião”, selecione o projeto e marque o horário como não faturável. Ao rastrear o tempo não faturável, você terá uma imagem mais realista de quanto tempo realmente gasta com o cliente (e não apenas o tempo pelo qual é pago). Você também pode adicionar uma etiqueta de reunião para filtrar as entradas de tempo por etiquetas em Relatórios.
5. Caso precise “corrigir” e descartar algumas entradas de horas, você pode acessar o **Relatório detalhado**, usar filtros para localizar os registros que deseja descartar e marcá-los como não faturáveis.

Faturar tempo rastreado #
-------------------------

1. Create invoice for client
2. Importe entradas de tempo não faturadas para a fatura e baixe o PDF

4. Marque a fatura como enviada ou paga para saber seu status
5. Veja todas as suas faturas com vencimento recente e filtre as pagas

# Billing tracked time - Clockify Help


## Chunk 1

Billing tracked time
====================

Lorsque vous facturez à l'heure, vous devez tenir compte du temps passé à travailler afin de savoir combien vous devez facturer à vos clients.

Outre le suivi des heures facturables, vous devez également suivre
le temps non facturable (par exemple, les emails, les appels Skype,
la préparation des factures, etc.) Vous ne pouvez pas avoir un véritable
aperçu de votre situation financière si vous ne savez pas combien de
temps prennent réellement les tâches.

Clockify vous aide à déterminer le nombre d'activités facturables et non facturables que vous effectuez et leur impact sur vos revenus.

L’interface utilisateur présentée dans cette vidéo peut ne pas correspondre à la dernière version de l’appli.

Supposons que vous ayez un nouveau client et que vous souhaitiez suivre vos taux de facturation.

Voici à quoi ressemblerait votre flux de travail Clockify :

Créez des projets #
-------------------

1. Définissez le taux facturable de chaque personne dans la section “Équipe” et un taux facturable par défaut dans les paramètres de l'espace de travail.
2. Ajouter un client sur la page Clients
3. Créez un nouveau projet dans la section “Projets” et sélectionnez le client. Si vous le souhaitez, vous pouvez également configurer :
   * Des tâches, fin de pouvoir les sélectionner lors du suivi du temps et regrouper ultérieurement les entrées de te


## Chunk 2

us pouvez également configurer :
   * Des tâches, fin de pouvoir les sélectionner lors du suivi du temps et regrouper ultérieurement les entrées de temps par tâche dans les rapports
   * Des estimations, afin de pouvoir comparer le temps estimé et le temps suivi sur les projets, et l'argent budgété et l'argent dépensé
   * Project and task billable rates, so Clockify can use a different billable rate when calculating how much you’ve earned on that particular project or task

Suivre le temps #
-----------------

1. Commencez à suivre le temps lorsque vous commencez à travailler : tapez ce sur quoi vous travaillez, sélectionnez le projet, cliquez sur $ pour marquer le temps comme facturable, et lancez le minuteur.
2. Arrêtez le minuteur lorsque vous cessez de travailler et le temps sera ajouté à votre feuille de temps.
3. Lorsque vous continuez à travailler sur quelque chose, appuyez sur l'icône de lecture à côté de l'entrée de temps appropriée pour relancer le minuteur pour cette activité.
4. Lorsque vous avez une réunion avec le client, lancez le minuteur, tapez "Réunion", choisissez le projet et marquez le temps comme non facturable. En suivant le temps non facturable de cette manière, vous aurez une idée plus réaliste du temps que vous consacrez réellement au client (et pas seulement du temps que vous facturez). Vous pouvez également ajouter une balise de **réunion** afin de


## Chunk 3

ue vous consacrez réellement au client (et pas seulement du temps que vous facturez). Vous pouvez également ajouter une balise de **réunion** afin de pouvoir filtrer les entrées de temps par balise dans les rapports.

Visualisez la répartition du temps dans les rapports #
------------------------------------------------------

1. Lorsque le moment est venu de facturer votre client à la fin du mois, allez dans le Rapport résumé, sélectionnez **Ce mois**, le projet (ou seulement le client si vous souhaitez facturer plusieurs projets que vous réalisez pour lui), n'affichez que les entrées de temps facturables, et cliquez sur **Filtrer** pour voir les entrées de temps que vous devez facturer.
2. Regroupez par projet et sous-groupez par entrée de temps pour rendre la décomposition des données plus utile.
3. Exportez le rapport avec une décomposition détaillée du temps en PDF et envoyez-le à votre client pour examen.
4. Si vous avez des clients qui veulent voir le temps que vous avez suivi à un moment donné, vous pouvez partager un rapport et envoyer le lien à votre client. Ce dernier peut alors consulter le rapport à tout moment et voir le travail accompli jusqu'à présent sur ses projets.
5. Si vous devez "pardonner" et annuler certaines entrées de temps, vous pouvez accéder au **Rapport détaillé**, utiliser des filtres pour trouver les entrées de temps que vous voulez annuler et le

es entrées de temps, vous pouvez accéder au **Rapport détaillé**, utiliser des filtres pour trouver les entrées de temps que vous voulez annuler et les marquer comme non facturables.

Facturation du temps suivi #
----------------------------

1. Créez une facture pour le client
2. Importez les entrées de temps non facturées dans la facture et télécharger le PDF
3. Si vous avez des entrées de temps que vous ne voulez pas importer dans la facture : vous pouvez sélectionner une autre plage de temps, choisir les projets dont vous n'avez pas besoin ou supprimer manuellement ces entrées
4. Marquez la facture comme envoyée ou payée pour savoir son statut
5. Visualisez toutes vos factures à échéance proche et filtrez celles qui ont été payées

# Billing tracked time - Clockify Help


## Chunk 1

Billing tracked time
====================

When you’re charging by the hour, you need to keep track of time you spend working so that you know how much to charge your clients.

In addition to tracking billable hours, you should also track non-billable time (e.g. emails, Skype calls, preparing invoices, etc.). You can’t have a real insight into your financial state if you don’t know how long tasks really take.

Clockify helps you see how much billable vs non-billable activity you do and how that affects your earnings.

User interface displayed in this video may not correspond to the latest version of the app.

Let’s say you have a new client and you want to track your billable rates.

Here’s what your Clockify workflow would look like:

Set up projects #
-----------------

1. Define billable rate for each person in Team section and a default billable rate in Workspace Settings.
2. Add a client on Clients page
3. Create a new project in Projects section and select the client. If you want, you can also set up:
   * Tasks, so you can select them when tracking time and later group time entries by task in reports
   * Estimates, so you can compare estimated vs tracked time on projects, and budgeted vs spent money
   * Project and task billable rates, so Clockify can use a different billable rate when calculating how much you’ve earned on that particular project or task

Track time #


## Chunk 2

illable rates, so Clockify can use a different billable rate when calculating how much you’ve earned on that particular project or task

Track time #
------------

1. Start tracking time when you start working: type what you’re working on, select the project, click $ to mark time as billable, and start the timer
2. Stop the timer when you stop working and the time will be added to your timesheet
3. When you continue working on something, press play icon next to the appropriate time entry to start the timer for that activity again.
4. When you’re having a meeting with the client, start the timer, type “Meeting”, choose project, and mark time as non-billable. By tracking non-billable time such as this, you’ll have a more realistic picture of how much time you’re really spending on the client (and not just the time you bill). You can also add a **meeting** tag so you can filter time entries by tags in Reports.

See time breakdown in reports #
-------------------------------

1. When the time comes to bill your client at the end of the month, go to the Summary report, select **This Month**, the project (or only the client if you want to bill for multiple projects you do for them), show only billable time entries, and click **Filter** to see time entries you need to invoice.
2. Group by Project and subgroup by Time Entry to make data breakdown more useful.
3. Export the report with


## Chunk 3

to see time entries you need to invoice.
2. Group by Project and subgroup by Time Entry to make data breakdown more useful.
3. Export the report with a detailed time breakdown in PDF and send it to your client for review.
4. If you have clients who want to see how much time you’ve tracked at any point, you can share a report and send the link to your client. Then, your client can then visit the report at any time and see what work has been done so far on their projects.
5. If you need to “forgive” and write-off some time entries, you can go to the **Detailed report**, use filters to find the time entries you want to write off, and mark them as non-billable.

Invoice tracked time #
----------------------

1. Create invoice for client
2. Import billable uninvoiced time entries into the invoice and download the PDF
3. If you have time entries that you don’t want to import into the invoice: you can select a different time range, choose which projects you don’t need, or manually remove those entries
4. Mark invoice as sent or paid to know its status
5. See all your invoices that are due soon and filter out the paid ones

# Billing tracked time - Clockify Help


## Chunk 1

Abrechnung der erfassten Zeit
=============================

Wenn du nach Stunden abrechnest, musst du die Zeit, die du für deine Arbeit aufwendest, im Auge behalten, um zu wissen, wie viel du deinen Kunden in Rechnung stellen kannst.

Zusätzlich zur Erfassung der abrechenbaren Stunden solltest du auch die nicht abrechenbare Zeit erfassen (z. B. E-Mails, Skype-Anrufe, Vorbereitung von Rechnungen usw.). Du kannst keinen wirklichen Einblick in deine finanzielle Situation bekommen, wenn du nicht weißt, wie lange Aufgaben wirklich dauern.

Clockify hilft dir dabei, zu erkennen, wie viel abrechenbare und wie viel nicht abrechenbare Aktivitäten du machst und wie sich das auf dein Einkommen auswirkt.

Die in diesem Video angezeigte Benutzeroberfläche entspricht möglicherweise nicht der aktuellen Version der App.

Angenommen, du hast einen neuen Kunden und möchtest deine abrechenbaren Sätze verfolgen.

So würde dein Clockify-Workflow aussehen:

Projekte einrichten #
---------------------

1. Einen abrechenbaren Satz für jede Person im Abschnitt “Team” und einen abrechenbaren Standardsatz in den Arbeitsbereichseinstellungen definieren
2. Kunden auf der Kundenseite hinzufügen
3. Ein neues Projekt im Abschnitt “Projekte” erstellen und den Kunden auswählen. Wenn du willst, kannst du auch einrichten:
   * Aufgaben, damit du diese bei der Zeiterfassung auswählen und später in Berichten die Z


## Chunk 2

nden auswählen. Wenn du willst, kannst du auch einrichten:
   * Aufgaben, damit du diese bei der Zeiterfassung auswählen und später in Berichten die Zeiteinträge nach Aufgaben gruppieren kannst
   * Voranschläge, sodass du die veranschlagte mit der verfolgten Projektzeit und die veranschlagten mit den ausgegebenen Mitteln vergleichen kannst
   * Project and task billable rates, so Clockify can use a different billable rate when calculating how much you’ve earned on that particular project or task

Zeit erfassen #
---------------

1. Du sollst mit der Zeiterfassung beginnen, wenn du mit der Arbeit beginnst: Du sollst eingeben, woran du arbeitest, das Projekt auswählen, auf $ klicken, um die Zeit als abrechenbar zu markieren, und den Timer starten.
2. Den Timer sollst du stoppen, wenn du aufhörst zu arbeiten, und die Zeit wird deiner Arbeitszeittabelle hinzugefügt.
3. Wenn du deine Arbeit fortsetzen möchtest, sollst du das Wiedergabe-Symbol neben dem entsprechenden Zeiteintrag drücken, um den Timer für diese Aktivität erneut zu starten.
4. Wenn du eine Besprechung mit dem Kunden hast, sollst du den Timer starten, "Besprechung" eingeben, das Projekt wählen und die Zeit als nicht abrechenbar markieren. Wenn du die nicht abrechenbare Zeit auf diese Weise erfasst, erhältst du ein realistischeres Bild davon, wie viel Zeit du wirklich für den Kunden aufwendest (und nicht nur von der Ze


## Chunk 3

eit auf diese Weise erfasst, erhältst du ein realistischeres Bild davon, wie viel Zeit du wirklich für den Kunden aufwendest (und nicht nur von der Zeit, die du in Rechnung stellst). Du kannst auch ein Tag für **Besprechung** hinzufügen, sodass du Zeiteinträge in Berichten nach Tags filtern kannst.

Zeitaufschlüsselung in Berichten anzeigen #
-------------------------------------------

1. Wenn es an der Zeit ist, deinem Kunden am Ende des Monats eine Rechnung zu stellen, sollst du zum Zusammenfassungsbericht gehen und **Diesen Monat** und das Projekt (oder nur den Kunden, wenn du mehrere Projekte für ihn abrechnen möchtest) wählen. Dann solltest du dir nur die abrechenbaren Zeiteinträge anzeigen lassen und auf  **Filter**  klicken, um die Zeiteinträge zu sehen, die du in Rechnung stellen musst.
2. Du hast die Möglichkeit, nach Projekt zu gruppieren und nach Zeiteintrag zu unterteilen, um die Aufschlüsselung der Daten nützlicher zu gestalten.
3. Mit einer detaillierten Zeitaufschlüsselung im PDF-Format kannst du den Bericht exportieren und ihn zur Überprüfung an deinen Kunden versenden.
4. Wenn du Kunden hast, die sehen möchten, wie viel Zeit du zu einem bestimmten Zeitpunkt erfasst hast, kannst du einen Bericht freigeben und den Link an deinen Kunden senden. Dein Kunde kann dann jederzeit den Bericht aufrufen und sehen, welche Arbeit bisher an seinen Projekten geleistet wurde.


## Chunk 4

Link an deinen Kunden senden. Dein Kunde kann dann jederzeit den Bericht aufrufen und sehen, welche Arbeit bisher an seinen Projekten geleistet wurde.
5. Wenn du einige Zeiteinträge "verzeihen" und abschreiben musst, kannst du den **detaillierten Bericht** aufrufen, mithilfe von Filtern die Zeiteinträge finden, die du abschreiben möchtest, und sie als nicht abrechenbar markieren.

Erfasste Zeit in Rechnung stellen #
-----------------------------------

1. Rechnung für Kunden erstellen
2. Abrechenbare, nicht fakturierte Zeiteinträge in die Rechnung importieren und das PDF herunterladen
3. Wenn du Zeiteinträge hast, die du nicht in die Rechnung importieren möchtest: Du kannst einen anderen Zeitbereich wählen, dann auswählen, welche Projekte du nicht benötigst, oder diese Einträge manuell als fakturiert markieren
4. Die Rechnung als gesendet oder bezahlt markieren, um über ihren Status informiert zu sein
5. Alle deine Rechnungen sehen, die bald fällig sind, und die bezahlten Rechnungen herausfiltern

## Chunk 1

Facturar el tiempo registrado
=============================

Cuando cobras por hora, necesitas mantener un registro de todo el tiempo que pasas trabajando para que sepas exactamente cuánto debes cobrar a tus clientes.

Junto con el seguimiento de las horas facturables, deberías realizar un seguimiento del tiempo no facturable (por ejemplo, correos electrónicos, llamadas de Skype, preparación de facturas, etc.). No puedes obtener un conocimiento real de tu estado financiero si no sabes cuánto tiempo realmente te toman las tareas.

Clockify te ayuda a ver cuánta actividad facturable y cuánta no facturable realizas y cómo eso afecta a tus ganancias.

La interfaz de usuario que se muestra en este vídeo puede no corresponder a la última versión de la aplicación.

Digamos que tienes un nuevo cliente y quieres hacer un seguimiento de tus tarifas facturables.

Así es como parecería tu flujo de trabajo en Clockify:

Establece proyectos #
---------------------

1. Define una tarifa facturable para cada persona en la sección de Equipo y una tarifa facturable predeterminada en la Configuración del espacio de trabajo
2. Añade a un cliente en la página de Clientes
3. Crea un nuevo proyecto en la sección de Proyectos y selecciona el cliente. Si quieres, también puedes configurar:

   * Tareas, para que puedas seleccionarlas al rastrear el tiempo y luego en informes agrupar las entradas de tiempo por tareas
   * Estimaciones, para que puedas comparar el tiempo estimado con el rastreado en proyectos, y el dinero presupuestado con el gastado
   * Project and task billable rates, so Clockify can use a different billable rate when calculating how much you’ve earned on that particular project or task

Controlar el tiempo #
---------------------

1. Empieza a controlar el tiempo cuando comiences a trabajar: escribe en qué estás trabajando, selecciona el proyecto, haz clic en € para marcar el tiempo como facturable e inicia el temporizador
2. Detén el temporizador cuando termines con el trabajo y el tiempo se añadirá a tu planilla horaria
3. Cuando sigas trabajando en algo, haz clic en el ícono de reproducción junto a la entrada de tiempo adecuada para iniciar de nuevo el temporizador para esa actividad
4. Cuando tengas una reunión con el cliente, inicia el temporizador, escribe “Reunión”, selecciona el proyecto y marca el tiempo como no facturable. Al rastrear el tiempo no facturable como éste, tendrás una idea más realista sobre cuánto tiempo realmente dedicas al cliente (y no solo el tiempo que cobras). También puedes añadir una etiqueta de **reunión** para que puedas filtrar las entradas de tiempo por etiquetas en Informes


## Chunk 3

solo el tiempo que cobras). También puedes añadir una etiqueta de **reunión** para que puedas filtrar las entradas de tiempo por etiquetas en Informes

Ve el desglose de tiempo en informes #
--------------------------------------

1. Cuando llegue el momento de facturar a tu cliente a fin de mes, ve al Informe resumido, selecciona **Este mes**, el proyecto (o solo el cliente si quieres facturar varios proyectos para los que realizas mostrar solo las entradas de tiempo facturables y haz clic en  **Filtrar** para ver las entradas de tiempo que necesitas facturar.
2. Agrupa por Proyecto y subgrupa por Entrada de tiempo para hacer que el desglose de datos sea aún más útil.
3. Exporta el informe con un desglose de tiempo detallado en PDF y envíalo a tu cliente para su revisión.
4. Si tienes clientes que quieren ver cuánto tiempo has rastreado en cualquier momento, puedes compartir el informe y enviar un enlace a tu cliente. Entonces, tu cliente puede visitar el informe en cualquier momento y ver qué trabajo se ha hecho hasta ese momento en sus proyectos
5. Si necesitas "perdonar" y descartar algunas entradas de tiempo, puedes ir al **Informe detallado**, usar filtros para encontrar las entradas de tiempo que quieres cancelar y marcarlas como no facturables.

Factura el tiempo rastreado #

# Bloquear planilhas de horas no Clockify


## Chunk 1

Você pode impedir que seus funcionários editem suas entradas de tempo antigas ou adicionem novas entradas a datas passadas bloqueando planilha de horas. Depois de bloquear as planilhas, você pode enviar seus relatórios com segurança para seus clientes ou o seu contador, sabendo que os dados permanecerão precisos.

Bloquear planilhas de horas é uma ferramenta paga, que você pode habilitar atualizando seu espaço de trabalho para o plano Standard, Pro ou Enterprise.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/lock.png)

Etapas para bloquear planilhas de horas #
-----------------------------------------

1. Navegue até o nome do espaço de trabalho
2. Abra o menu
3. Escolha **Configurações do espaço de trabalho** no menu suspenso
4. Mude para a guia **Permissões**
5. Clique na opção **Bloquear o tempo** para ativar
6. Especifique uma data e hora antes das quais todas as entradas de tempo serão bloqueadas
7. As alterações serão salvas automaticamente quando você selecionar a data ou alternar a opção **Bloquear tempo** antes

Quando as entradas são bloqueados antes de 15 de abril, por exemplo, isso significa que os usuários regulares não poderão:

* Editar qualquer entrada de tempo com uma data igual ou anterior a 14 de abril
* Adicionar novas entradas de tempo com a dat


## Chunk 2

regulares não poderão:

* Editar qualquer entrada de tempo com uma data igual ou anterior a 14 de abril
* Adicionar novas entradas de tempo com a data de 14 de abril ou antes

O bloqueio da planilha de horas não afeta os administradores. Os administradores ainda podem editar e adicionar tempo no período bloqueado.

Para desbloquear, ative o botão novamente e todos poderão editar todas as suas entradas de tempo e adicionar novas a qualquer data que desejarem.

Se você bloquear uma planilha todos os meses e tiver usuários em fusos horários diferentes, deverá definir o bloqueio para o dia 2 de cada mês. Se você definir para o dia 1º do mês, seu dispositivo que está no fuso horário mais recente não poderá inserir datas para o último dia do mês anterior devido à diferença de fuso horário.

Bloqueio automático #
---------------------

Configure o bloqueio automático e a data de bloqueio será atualizada automaticamente todos os dias, semanas ou meses, para que você não precise mais fazer isso manualmente.

2. Vá para Configurações do espaço de trabalho e mude para a guia Permissões
3. Selecione **Atualizar automaticamente a data de bloqueio** e ative
4. Selecione o período do tempo de bloqueio (semanal, mensal, antes de x dias/semanas/meses)

Ao selecionar a opção **Semanal**, você precisa selecionar dois dias: quando a data de bloqueio for atualizada (por exemplo, quarta-feira) e o primeiro dia da semana na sua empresa (por exemplo, segunda-feira). Dessa forma, quando uma nova semana começar (na segunda-feira), sua equipe ainda poderá adicionar as horas faltantes da semana anterior antes que essa semana seja bloqueada (o que acontece na quarta-feira).

Quando o bloqueio automático estiver ativado, você não poderá definir manualmente uma data de bloqueio.

Quando você define a **atualização da data de bloqueio para 1 dia**, no final de cada dia a data de bloqueio será atualizada automaticamente para que os usuários não possam editar suas horas do dia anterior.

O bloqueio diário é atualizado todos os dias à meia-noite, usando o fuso horário do proprietário do espaço de trabalho.

Se você bloquear planilha de horas mensalmente e tiver usuários em fusos horários diferentes, deverá definir o bloqueio automático para o dia 2 de cada mês; caso contrário, sua equipe com o fuso horário mais recente não poderá inserir datas para o último dia do mês.

Você não pode bloquear datas atuais ou futuras.

Para evitar que as pessoas adicionem tempo manualmente para hoje ou para o futuro (ou alterem o horário de início/término de suas entradas), você precisa habilitar o Forçar cronômetro.

# Bloquear planillas de horarios en Clockify


## Chunk 1

Puedes evitar que tus empleados editen sus entradas de tiempo anteriores o añadan nuevas entradas a fechas pasadas bloqueando las planillas horarias. Una vez que bloquees las planillas, puedes enviar tus informes de manera segura a tus clientes o a tu contable sabiendo que los datos se mantendrán precisos.

Bloquear planillas horarias es una función de pago que puedes habilitar actualizando tu espacio de trabajo al plan Standard, Pro, o Enterprise.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/lock.png)

Pasos para bloquear las planillas de horarios #
-----------------------------------------------

1. Navega hasta el nombre del espacio de trabajo
2. Abre el menú
3. Selecciona **Configuración del espacio de trabajo** del menú desplegable
4. Cambia a la pestaña **Permisos**
5. Alterna el interruptor **Bloquear entradas** para activar
6. Especifica una fecha y hora antes de la cual se bloquearán todas las entradas de tiempo

## Chunk 2

ue los usuarios regulares no podrán:

* Editar cualquier entrada de tiempo con la fecha del 14 de abril o antes
* Añadir nuevas entradas de tiempo con la fecha 14 de abril o antes

El bloqueo de planillas horarias no afecta a los administradores. Los administradores aún pueden editar y añadir tiempo en el período bloqueado.

Para desbloquear, vuelve a alternar el interruptor y todos podrán editar todas sus entradas de tiempo y añadir otras nuevas a cualquier fecha que quieran.

Si bloqueas las planillas cada mes y tienes usuarios en distintas zonas horarias, debes configurar el bloqueo para el día 2 de cada mes. Si lo configuras para el 1° del mes, tu equipo que está en la zona horaria más tardía no podrá ingresar fechas para el último día del mes anterior debido a la diferencia de zona horaria.

Bloqueo automático #
--------------------

Configura el bloqueo automático y la fecha de bloqueo se actualizará automáticamente cada día, semana o mes para que ya no tengas que hacerlo manualmente.

3. Cambia **Actualizar automáticamente la fecha de bloqueo** a SÍ
4. Selecciona la frecuencia y el tiempo de bloqueo (semanal, mensual, anterior a x días/semanas/meses)

Al seleccionar la opción **Semanal**, debes seleccionar dos días: cuándo se actualizará la fecha de bloqueo (p. ej., miércoles) y cuál es el primer día de la semana en tu empresa (p. ej., lunes). De esta manera, cuando comienza una nueva semana (el lunes), tu equipo aún puede añadir las horas que faltan de la semana anterior antes de que esa semana se bloquee (lo que sucede el miércoles).

Cuando el bloqueo automático está habilitado, no podrás configurar manualmente una fecha de bloqueo.

Cuando configuras **actualizar fecha de bloqueo de más de 1 día**, eso significa que al final de cada día, la fecha de bloqueo se actualizará automáticamente para que los usuarios no puedan editar sus horas de ayer.

El bloqueo diario se actualiza cada día a medianoche, utilizando la zona horaria del propietario del espacio de trabajo.

Si bloqueas las planillas de horarios mensualmente y tienes usuarios en diferentes zonas horarias, debes configurar el bloqueo automático para el día 2 de cada mes; de lo contrario, tu equipo que esté en la zona horaria más tardía no podrá ingresar fechas para el último día del mes.

# Browser extension - Clockify Help


## Chunk 1

Clockify Time Tracker for browser lets you track time from anywhere on the web, without opening Clockify.

Get Chrome extension →

Get Firefox extension →

For step-by-step guidance on using Clockify in your browser, watch the video and follow the instructions below.

How it works #
--------------

### Log in #

To start tracking time, you’ll first need to log in to the browser extension.

To log in:

1. Click the **Login** button
2. You’ll be redirected to the web app **Login** screen
   ![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screenshot-2024-01-31-at-09.57.18.png)
3. Continue the process by entering and verifying your email

After you complete the login process, you can start using the extension and tracking time.

If you’re already logged in, the extension will automatically open Clockify.
If you don’t have a Clockify account yet, you can create it by clicking the New here? **Create an account** button.

### Logging in with custom domain and subdomain #

Users on custom domain or subdomain can also use the Chrome browser extension:

Click **Submit** and log in with your email or SSO.

### Time tracking #

Once you’ve logged in to the extension, type what you’re working on and start the timer.

To edit the running time, click on the running entry to bring up its details. There you can change the description, change running time, mark time as billable, and add project and tags.

You can also edit past time entries by clicking on them, or add time manually (once you switch to manual mode in the settings).

To quickly continue tracking time, click on the play icon for the time entry you wish to continue, and the timer will start ticking again for that entry.

Clockify also supports tracking holidays and time off on the web app. Time off and holiday entries are distinctly displayed in the tracker.

---------------------------------------

If you’re involved in an extensive project and task planning but would like to easily navigate through the Clockify web app, you have the option to start the timer from the created projects and tasks on the **Projects** page.

In order to use this feature, you need to be logged in to the Clockify browser extension and the Clockify web app with the same account.

Once you’re logged in:

1. Navigate to the **Projects** page
2. Find the project you’d like to track time for
3. Hover over the project and the start button will appear

   ![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screenshot-2024-03-25-at-09.52.53.png)
6. Choose project task, make some other modifications, or stop the timer

To start the timer for a project task:

1. Click on the project in the **Projects** page
2. Go to the **Task** tab
3. Hover over the task and the start button will appear
4. Click on the button
5. Timer will start running and the time entry details window will appear
6. The extension will pick up project and task name from the web app
   Task name will be additionally in the description

If you stop the timer in the extension, that entry will be added in the time tracker with all other info related to that entry.

Start time button is not available for archived projects and tasks.

Default project and task #
--------------------------

If you work on the same project every day, set a default project or task. Then, all you have to do is type what you’re working on, start the timer, and the project will be selected automatically.

You can select:

* **Fixed project** to always use when you start a timer for an entry without project
* **Fixed task** to always use when you start a timer for an entry without project/task
* **Last used project** to pick up most recently used available project (if task is requ


## Chunk 5

use when you start a timer for an entry without project/task
* **Last used project** to pick up most recently used available project (if task is required, task will also be picked up)

Enable default project in the Settings.

Idle detection #
----------------

While tracking time, Clockify browser extension can detect when you’re away from your computer so you don’t accidentally log that time. The extension detects when you’re inactive based on your mouse and keyboard movements.

If there’s no mouse movement or keyboard strokes for X minutes, the timer will enter into idle mode. It will continue running, but it will treat those X minutes (and the time after that) as idle. When you become active, a notification will pop up, asking what you want to do with the idle time.

You can choose to:

* **Discard idle time** – The timer will be stopped and the detected idle time will be removed from its total.
* **Discard and continue** – The current timer will be stopped, the detected idle time will be removed from its total, and a new timer will immediately start for the same activity.
* **Keep idle time** – The timer will keep running as it is. In order to keep idle time in the extension, simply close or dismiss the notification.

Can’t see idle notification?

**To set up idle time detection in the extension:**

1. Click on the **Clockify timer button** located in the upper right-hand


## Chunk 6

ee idle notification?

**To set up idle time detection in the extension:**

1. Click on the **Clockify timer button** located in the upper right-hand corner of your browser
2. Open the extension settings by clicking on the **hamburger icon**
3. Go to **Settings**
4. Select **Idle detection** checkbox
5. Specify the number of minutes of inactivity after which the idle time will be detected
6. Click **Done**

Idle detection will work only if you started the timer from the extension (it won’t work if you started the timer from the web but have the extension installed).

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-25-at-10.08.12-623x1024.png)

Pomodoro #
----------

With the Pomodoro timer, set up notifications to let you know when it’s time to take a short break.

To enable Pomodoro:

1. Open the extension settings by clicking on the hamburger icon
2. Go to **Settings**
3. Check the **Enable Pomodoro timer**

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-25-at-10.14.51.png)

**Timer interval** – set how long will your Pomodoro session last.

**Short break** – set how long will your short break last.

**Long break** – set how long will your long break last and after how many short breaks it will occur. For example, if you set Long break starts after 3 short breaks your fourth break will be the long break.

For Long Break t


## Chunk 7

short breaks it will occur. For example, if you set Long break starts after 3 short breaks your fourth break will be the long break.

For Long Break to work you would need to start/stop the timer from the notification popup. If you stop the timer manually, it will reset the count sessions and will start over.

If you have built-in notification sound enabled in Windows already, the notification will play both sounds so it’s best to have just one option enabled.

Disable/enable notification sound on Windows by going to **Settings**>**System**>**Notifications & actions** then click on the **Google Chrome** icon (note: this switch should still be set to ON) and switch off or on **Play sound when the notification arrives**.

**Default break project** – Select the default project on which the break timer will be logged (**Last used project** will take the project/task from the timer just before the break).

**Automatic** **breaks** – You can choose to automatically start/stop the timer when the Pomodoro period or break ends.

**Focus mode** – When enabled, your time logs will be hidden while you have the timer running and you’ll just see a visual representation of time left.

## Chunk 8

nshot-2024-03-25-at-10.17.32-625x1024.png)

Start/stop automatically #
--------------------------

You can automatically start/stop the timer when you open/close the browser so you don’t have to worry about clocking in when you start working or clocking out when you finish with your work.

1. Open the extension settings by clicking on the hamburger icon
2. Go to **Settings**
3. Check the **Start timer when browser starts** and/or **Stop timer when browser closes**

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-08-at-14.31.52.png)

If you shut down your PC and leave the browser open the timer will continue working. You would have to close the browser first and then turn off the computer in order for the timer to stop.

In case you have both idle detection and auto-stop enabled, if the timer is stopped automatically, idle detection will not trigger (meaning idle time will be kept).

To see more about how it works, follow this link.

Notifications #
---------------

Notifications are located under the bell icon at the top-right corner of the screen.

**Synchronization across platforms**

Notifications in the extensions sync with those on the web app. If you’ve read notifications on the web app, they’re marked as read in the Clockify extension.

**Visual indicators for new notifications**

New notifications are marked with an orange dot and a count. Cli


## Chunk 9

rked as read in the Clockify extension.

**Visual indicators for new notifications**

New notifications are marked with an orange dot and a count. Click the bell to read them.

Reminders #
-----------

Simply check **Remind to track time** box in the Clockify browser extension settings, specify the interval (e.g. 10 minutes), and you will receive a notification from Clockify every 10 minutes, reminding you to use the timer.

You can also set **reminder start and end time**, and the reminder notification will only appear during this time period (e.g. from 08:00 to 16:00).

And, you can also set **days for which you want to enable/disable reminders**. If you don’t want to receive reminders on Sundays for example, leave it unchecked.

To see more about how it works, follow this link.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-08-at-14.39.18.png)

Integrations #
--------------

Start Clockify timer in other web tools, like Jira, Trello, Asana, Gitlab, Basecamp, Slack, Github, Pumble, Google Calendar, Xero…

If you try to stop the timer from another website and you get an error, it means that project is a required field. You’ll either have to add the project manually from extension, enable the creation of projects/tasks/tags in the extension’s settings, or disable required field (if you have Timesheet enabled, project field is automatically required)


## Chunk 10

of projects/tasks/tags in the extension’s settings, or disable required field (if you have Timesheet enabled, project field is automatically required).

The extension can also pick up project name from another app if there’s a project in Clockify with the same name, and create and select projects, tasks, and tags based on the integration. Here’s how.

You can also make Clockify work with self-hosted instances of software (like JIRA, Redmine, etc.), here’s how.

When you start a timer via a **Start timer** button, a popup will appear where you can add a project and edit other information for the time entry. You can disable this in the extension’s Settings > **Show post-start** **popup**.

Zeit von der Projektseite der Web-App verfolgen #
-------------------------------------------------

Wenn du an einem Projekt oder einer Aufgabe arbeitest, das/die umfassend ist, aber durch die Clockify-Web-App einfach navigieren willst, steht dir die Option zur Verfügung, den Timer aus erstellten Projekten oder Aufgaben auf der Seite **Projekte** zu starten.

Um diese Funktion zu benutzen, solltest du bei der Clockify-Browsererweiterung und den Clockify-Web-App mit demselben Konto angemeldet sein.

Wenn du dich angemeldet hast, solltest du:

1. Zur Seite **Projekte** navigieren
2. Projekt finden, für das du Zeit erfassen willst
3. Auf das Projekt zeigen und die Starttaste wird angezeigt
4. Die Taste anklicken
5. Der Timer wird aktiviert und das Fenster mit Details des Zeiteintrags wird angezeigt
   ![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screenshot-2024-03-25-at-09.52.53.png)
6. Projektaufgabe wählen, andere Änderungen vornehmen oder den Timer stoppen

Um den Timer für eine Projektaufgabe zu starten, solltest du:

1. Auf der Seite **Projekte** das Projekt anklicken
2. Zur Registerkarte **Aufgabe** gehen
3. Auf die Aufgabe zeigen und die Starttaste wird angezeigt
4. Die Taste anklicken
5.


## Chunk 5

2. Zur Registerkarte **Aufgabe** gehen
3. Auf die Aufgabe zeigen und die Starttaste wird angezeigt
4. Die Taste anklicken
5. Der Timer wird aktiviert und das Fenster mit Details des Zeiteintrags wird angezeigt
6. Die Erweiterung übernimmt den Projekt- und Aufgabennamen von der Web-App.
   Den Aufgabenname kannst du auch in der Beschreibung finden.

Wenn du den Timer in der Erweiterung stoppst, wird dieser Eintrag mit allen anderen Informationen über den Eintrag in die Zeiterfassung hinzugefügt.

Die Starttaste ist für archivierte Projekte und Aufgaben nicht verfügbar.

Standardprojekt und -aufgabe #
------------------------------

Wenn du jeden Tag an demselben Projekt arbeitest, kannst du ein Standardprojekt oder eine Standardaufgabe festlegen. Dann musst du nur noch eingeben, woran du arbeitest, den Timer starten, und das Projekt wird automatisch ausgewählt.

Du kannst wählen:

* **Festes Projekt,** das immer verwendet wird, wenn du einen Timer für einen Eintrag ohne Projekt startest
* **Feste Aufgabe,** die immer verwendet wird, wenn du einen Timer für einen Eintrag ohne Projekt oder Aufgabe startest
* **Zuletzt verwendetes Projekt,** und der Timer holt das zuletzt verwendete verfügbare Projekt ab (wenn eine Aufgabe erforderlich ist, wird diese auch abgeholt)

Du kannst das Standardprojekt in den Einstellungen aktivieren.

Du kannst das Standardprojekt in den Einstellungen aktivieren.

Leerlauferkennung #
-------------------

Bei der Zeiterfassung kann die Clockify-Browsererweiterung erkennen, wenn du nicht an deinem Computer sitzt, damit du diese Zeit nicht versehentlich protokollierst. Die Erweiterung erkennt anhand deiner Maus- und Tastaturbewegungen, wenn du inaktiv bist.

Wenn es X Minuten lang keine Mausbewegungen oder Tastenanschläge gibt, geht der Timer in den Leerlaufmodus über. Er läuft dann weiter, aber er behandelt diese X Minuten (und die Zeit danach) als Leerlaufzeit. Wenn du aktiv wirst, wird eine Benachrichtigung angezeigt, in der du gefragt wirst, was du mit der Leerlaufzeit machen möchtest.

Dann kannst du dich entscheiden:

* **Leerlaufzeit verwerfen** - Der Timer wird gestoppt und die erkannte Leerlaufzeit wird von der Gesamtzeit abgezogen.
* **Verwerfen und fortfahren** - Der aktuelle Timer wird gestoppt, die erkannte Leerlaufzeit wird von der Gesamtzeit abgezogen, und ein neuer Timer wird sofort für dieselbe Aktivität gestartet.
* **Leerlaufzeit beibehalten** - Der Timer läuft weiter, wie er ist. Um die Leerlaufzeit in der Erweiterung beizubehalten, solltest du einfach die Benachrichtigung schließen oder sie verwerfen.

Du kannst die Leerlauf-Benachrichtigung nicht sehen?

Du kannst die Leerlauf-Benachrichtigung nicht sehen?

**So richtest du die Leerlauferkennung in der Erweiterung ein:**

1. Auf die **Schaltfläche Clockify-Timer** klicken, die in der rechten oberen Ecke deines Browsers zu finden ist
2. Die Einstellungen der Erweiterung öffnen, indem du auf das **Hamburger-Symbol** klickst
3. Zu **Einstellungen** gehen
4. Das Kontrollkästchen **Leerlauferkennung**  aktivieren
5. Die Anzahl der Minuten der Inaktivität angeben, nach denen die Leerlaufzeit erkannt werden soll
6. Auf **Fertig** klicken

Die Leerlauferkennung funktioniert nur, wenn du den Timer über die Erweiterung gestartet hast (sie funktioniert nicht, wenn du den Timer über das Web gestartet hast, aber die Erweiterung installiert hast).

**Timer-Intervall** - Du kannst festlegen, wie lange deine Pomodoro-Sitzung dauern soll.

**Kurze Pause** - Auch kannst du festlegen, wie lange deine kurze Pause dauern soll.

**Lange Pause** - Und du kannst festlegen, wie lange die lange Pause dauern soll und nach wie vielen kurzen Pausen sie stattfinden soll. Wenn du z. B. einstellst, dass die lange Pause nach 3 kurzen Pausen beginnt, wird die vierte Pause zur langen Pause.

Damit die lange Pause funktioniert, musst du den Timer über das Benachrichtigungspopup starten/stoppen. Wenn du den Timer manuell stoppst, wird die Anzahl der Sitzungen zurückgesetzt und beginnt von vorne.

Wenn du den integrierten Benachrichtigungston in Windows bereits aktiviert hast, werden bei der Benachrichtigung beide Töne wiedergegeben; daher ist es am besten, nur eine Option zu aktivieren.

Du kannst den Benachrichtigungston in Windows deaktivieren/aktivieren, indem du zu **Einstellungen**>**System**>**Benachrichtigungen & Aktionen** gehst, dann auf das **Google Chrome**-Symbol klickst (Hinweis: Dieser Schalter sollte immer noch auf EIN stehen) und die Option **Bei Eingang der Benachrichtigung Ton wiedergeben** ein- oder ausschalten.

Automatisch starten/stoppen #
-----------------------------

Du kannst den Timer automatisch starten/stoppen, wenn du den Browser öffnest/schließt, sodass du dich nicht darum kümmern musst, bei Arbeitsbeginn einzustempeln oder nach Beendigung deiner Arbeit auszustempeln.

1. Die Einstellungen der Erweiterung öffnen, indem du auf das Hamburger-Symbol klickst
2. Zu **Einstellungen** gehen
3. Die Option **Timer starten, wenn der Browser startet** und/oder die Option **Timer stoppen, wenn der Browser geschlossen wird** wählen

Wenn du deinen PC herunterfährst und den Browser geöffnet lässt, läuft der Timer weiter. Du musst zuerst den Browser schließen und dann den Computer ausschalten, damit der Timer stoppt.

Falls du sowohl die Leerlauferkennung als auch die automatische Stoppfunktion aktiviert hast, wird die Leerlauferkennung nicht aktiviert, wenn der Timer automatisch gestoppt wird (d. h. die Leerlaufzeit wird beibehalten).

Weitere Informationen dazu findest du unter diesem Link.

Benachrichtigungen #
--------------------

Benachrichtigungen befinden sich unter dem Glockensymbol oben rechts auf dem Bildschirm.

**Plattformübergreifende Synchronisierung**

Die Benachrichtigungen in der Erweiterung werden mit denen in der Web-App synchronisiert. Wenn du Benachrichtigungen in der Web-App gelesen hast, werden sie als “gelesen” in der Clockify-Erweiterung markiert.

**Visuelle Indikatoren für neue Benachrichtigungen**

Neue Benachrichtigungen sind mit einem orangefarbenen Punkt und einer Zählung markiert. Klicke auf die Glocke, um sie zu lesen.

Erinnerungen #
--------------

Du kannst einfach das Kontrollkästchen **"An die Zeiterfassung erinnern"** in den Einstellungen der Clockify-Browsererweiterung wählen, dann das Intervall angeben (z. B. 10 Minuten), und du erhältst alle 10 Minuten eine Benachrichtigung von Clockify, d

Du kannst auch **eine Start- und Endzeit für die Erinnerung** festlegen, sodass die Erinnerungsbenachrichtigung nur während dieses Zeitraums erscheint (z. B. von 08:00 bis 16:00 Uhr).

Du kannst auch **Tage festlegen, für die du Erinnerungen aktivieren/deaktivieren möchtest**. Wenn du z. B. sonntags keine Erinnerungen erhalten möchtest, lass die Option deaktiviert.

Weitere Informationen dazu findest du unter diesem Link.

Integrationen #
---------------

Starte den Clockify-Timer aus anderen Web-Tools wie JIRA, Trello, Asana, Gitlab, Basecamp, Slack, Github, Pumble, Google-Kalendar, Xero, usw.

Wenn du versuchst, den Timer von einer anderen Website aus zu stoppen und eine Fehlermeldung erhältst, bedeutet dies, dass das Projekt ein Pflichtfeld ist. Du musst entweder das Projekt manuell über die Erweiterung hinzufügen, die Erstellung von Projekten/Aufgaben/Tags in den Einstellungen der Erweiterung aktivieren oder das Pflichtfeld deaktivieren (wenn du die Option "Arbeitszeittabelle" aktiviert hast, ist das Projektfeld automatisch erforderlich).

Die Erweiterung kann auch Projektnamen aus ei

(wenn du die Option "Arbeitszeittabelle" aktiviert hast, ist das Projektfeld automatisch erforderlich).

Die Erweiterung kann auch Projektnamen aus einer anderen App übernehmen, wenn es in Clockify ein Projekt mit demselben Namen gibt, und Projekte, Aufgaben und Tags basierend auf der Integration erstellen und auswählen. So geht's.

Du kannst Clockify auch mit selbstgehosteten Instanzen von Software (wie JIRA, Redmine usw.) verwenden, so funktioniert es.

Wenn du einen Timer über die Schaltfläche **Timer starten** startest, erscheint ein Popup, in dem du ein Projekt hinzufügst und andere Informationen für den Zeiteintrag bearbeiten kannst. Du kannst dies in den Einstellungen der Erweiterung > **Popup nach dem Start anzeigen** deaktivieren.

# Budget und Voranschläge verfolgen - Clockify-Hilfe


## Chunk 1

Wenn du Projekte mit festen Gebühren hast, kannst du ihren Fortschritt verfolgen und einsehen, wie viel Budget ausgegeben wurde, indem Voranschläge in monetärer Hinsicht erstellt wurden. Du erhältst auch Benachrichtigungen, wenn du das Budget fast überschreitest.

Das Projektbudget ist eine kostenpflichtige Funktion, die du aktivieren kannst, indem du deinen Arbeitsbereich auf den Pro- oder Enterprise-Abonnementplan aktualisierst.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/project-budget-11.png)

Projektbudget definieren #
--------------------------

Um das Projektbudget zu erstellen, solltest du:

1. Gehe zur Seite **"Projekte"**
2. Projekt wählen und auf die Registerkarte **Einstellungen** im Projekt klicken
3. Im Abschnitt **Projektvoranschlag** **Projektbudget** wählen
   ![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2024-06-13-at-16.20.50.png)
   * Du kannst das Gesamtbudget mit der Option **Manuell** einrichten.
   * Oder du kannst **Aufgabenbasiert** wählen und dann das Budget für jede einzelne Aufgabe im Projekt (der Gesamtfortschritt des Projekts ist immer die Summe aller Aufgabenbudgets im Projekt) definieren.

Sobald das Projektbudget ausgewählt wird, geben die Registerkarte “Projektstatus” und die Fortschrittsanzeige des Projekts den abrechenbaren Betrag jedes Eintrags im Projekt vs das Budget wieder, und es wird angezeigt, wie vie

Du kannst auch auswählen, abrechenbare Ausgaben als ein Teil des Projektbudgets einzubeziehen, indem du **"Budget umfasst abrechenbare Ausgaben"** aktivierst.

Die  Warnmeldungen berücksichtigen immer den Projektstatus, und sie werden gesendet, egal ob die Projektschätzung in Zeit oder im Budget erstellt wurde.

Wiederkehrende Voranschläge #
-----------------------------

Wenn du Projekte hast, die über unterschiedliche Budgets in unterschiedlichen Zeiträumen verfügen, kannst du **“Budget (oder Voranschlag) zurücksetzen”** nach einem Zeitraum in der Registerkarte der Projekteinstellungen wählen, die sich unter dem Abschnitt “Voranschläge” befindet.

**![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/iXXE0lQq4sduK-dhRU59CBQMZDjXzcW6tVQJ6ErcNBAA9mM_ckuDS3ftCjHTYVzBd8P_1HYFl7PruD-zcdoXYZNgQDrDhqbXJ7ZKs7dGRbbpneVhAH_tkmJI1DOqYXzpQZDX-1jWmnpOhKRby6IO_D4)**

Projektschätzungen können für einen von diesen drei Zeiträumen zurückgesetzt werden:

* Woche (Montag ist der Standardtag)
* Monat (Standardzeitraum, der erste Tag im Monat ist der Standardtag)
* Jahr (Januar ist der Standardmonat, der 1. Tag im Monat ist der Standardtag, 00:00 ist die Standarduhrzeit)

## Chunk 3

Jahr (Januar ist der Standardmonat, der 1. Tag im Monat ist der Standardtag, 00:00 ist die Standarduhrzeit)

Um das Zurücksetzen von Schätzungen auf wöchentlicher/monatlicher/jährlicher Basis festzulegen, solltest du:

1. Zur Seite **"Projekte"** in der Seitenleiste gehen
2. Registerkarte **"Einstellungen"** wählen
3. Zum Abschnitt **"Projektschätzungen"** navigieren
4. Schalter **“Schätzung jede/-n/-s (Zeitraum) am (Datum) um (Uhrzeit) zurücksetzen”**  einschalten

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-13-at-16.26.02.png)

Jetzt, wenn die Schätzung nach jeder/-m (Woche/Monat/Jahr) an jedem (Datum) um jede (Uhrzeit) zurückgesetzt wird, kehrt die Projekt-Fortschrittsanzeige auf 0% zurück.

Die Aktion kann von Admins und Besitzern durchgeführt werden und ist Projektmanagern für Projekte verfügbar, denen sie zugewiesen sind, wenn **"Wer kann Stundensätze und Beträge sehen"**  auf **"Jeder"** festgelegt ist.

Wenn du den Schätzungszeitraum festgelegt hast, wird er auf alle früheren Zeiträume angewendet. Außerdem werden nur Zeiteinträge, die zum aktuell festgelegten Zeitraum gehören, im Abschnitt **Erfasst vs Geschätzt** des Projektstatus angezeigt.
Warnmeldungen berücksichtigen die Option zum Zurücksetzen.

Das Zeitformat in der Schätzung wird in Profileinstellungen festgelegt.

Wenn das Zurücksetzen von Schätzungen aktiviert ist:

Das Zeitformat in der Schätzung wird in Profileinstellungen festgelegt.

Wenn das Zurücksetzen von Schätzungen aktiviert ist:

* Information über die Währung pro Zeit ist in den **Projektschätzungen** definiert
* Die Rücksetzperiode wird im Projekt definiert und angezeigt, wenn du auf das Projekt zeigst
* Mit dem **Aufgabenbasierte-Schätzung-Typ** werden auch **Zeitvoranschläge**, **Projektbudget**, **Erfasst**, **Betrag**, **Status** und **Fortschritt** zurückgesetzt
* Änderung wird auf **Warnmeldungen** und **Überwachungsprotokoll** angewendet

Zeitvoranschläge in Berichten #
-------------------------------

Nur Admins können Schätzungen in Berichten einsehen, teilen und herunterladen.

Um Schätzungen und Budget für jedes Projekt und jede Aufgabe im Bericht zu sehen, solltest du:

1. **Zusammenfassungsbericht** öffnen
2. **Schätzungen anzeigen** aktivieren

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-1.png)

Die Voranschläge und das Budget für jedes Projekt und jede Aufgabe werden neben der erfassten Zeit angezeigt.

Du kannst den Bericht mit Schätzungen über Export auch herunterladen, oder die Schätzungszahlen teilen, wenn du einen Bericht teilst.

Die exportierten Dateien haben nur dann Schätzungen, wenn die Gruppierungsebene entweder **Projekt** oder **Aufgabe**ist, oder beides. Du solltest auch beachten, dass **"Voranschläge anzeigen"** aktivi

, wenn die Gruppierungsebene entweder **Projekt** oder **Aufgabe**ist, oder beides. Du solltest auch beachten, dass **"Voranschläge anzeigen"** aktiviert ist.

Berechtigungen #
----------------

Es hängt von den Berechtigungen ab, die in **"Wer kann abrechenbare Sätze sehen"**  **and amounts** und **"Wer kann den Projektstatus sehen"** in den Arbeitsbereichseinstellungen festgelegt sind, wer das Budget sehen darf.

Wenn die Berechtigungen auf “Admin” festgelegt sind:

* Nur Admins können das Projektbudget für alle Projekte sehen

Wenn diese auf “Jeder” festgelegt sind:

* Admins und Projektmanager\* können das Projektbudget sehen und festlegen
  \**Projektmanager können das Projektbudget sehen, wenn sie abrechenbare Sätze sehen können*
* Reguläre Benutzer können nur das Projektbudget und den Projektfortschritt sehen

# Budgetprognose in Projekten - Clockify-Hilfe


## Chunk 1

Außer der Erfassung der für Projekte und Aufgaben aufgewendeten Zeit ermöglicht es dir Clockify, das Budget für jedes Projekt oder jede Aufgabe zu prognostizieren. Mit dieser Funktion kannst du dein Budget vorausplanen und dich für zukünftige Projekte vorbereiten.

Diese Funktion steht allen Administratorbenutzern mit dem Pro- und einem höheren Abonnementplan oder während der kostenlosen Testversion zur Verfügung.

Um die Schätzungen für das Projektbudget zu aktivieren, muss die Fakturierbarkeit von Projekten in den Arbeitsbereichseinstellungen aktiviert sein.

Um die Fakturierbarkeit zu aktivieren, solltest du:

1. **Arbeitsbereichseinstellungen** öffnen
2. Zum Abschnitt **Abrechenbare Stunden** in der Registerkarte **Berechtigungen** gehen
3. **Abrechenbare Stunden aktivieren** einschalten

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcmhg58WGXmTb5EXQCne8Js6Ixq8QrzndhyvF3mmfNMoR3WP2cmQS-na4aZzRHIMsNweJ6fPXmXPNsSYNzqIFEu4eQWBTDeS-SPoe60rc7OeDwIgNPbOuIDWdI8Q33nGs-ScSIR3EeCyBQQVOmEqja_gkcJ?key=pTB0YyJ4dzFuEhOQCLtltw)

So werden alle für diesen Arbeitsbereich erstellten Einträge als abrechenbar markiert, was dir ermöglicht, ein Budget festzulegen und Ausgaben effektiv zu überwachen.

Du kannst für ein bestimmtes Projekt Einstellungen für die Fakturierbarkeit nach Bedarf anpassen.

Um die Fakturierbarkeit von Projekten zu aktivieren, solltest du:

* Der Diagramm für das geschätzte Budget wird aus Werten auf der X- und Y-Achse erstellt, wobei die Schnittpunkte die Datenpunkte darstellen
* Alle numerischen Werte folgen deinen **Arbeitsbereichseinstellungen** für die Formatierung
* Werte werden mit zwei Dezimalstellen angezeigt und die Währung wird durch deine Arbeitsbereicheinstellungen oder den jeweiligen Kunden bestimmt

**Y-Achse:**:

* Stellt monetäre Werte (Geldwerte) dar
* Der minimale Wert ist, wo sich die zwei Achsen zuerst schneiden, während der maximale Wert der höchste Punkt auf dem Diagramm innerhalb des ausgewählten Zeitraums ist
* Nur Zahlen ohne Währungssymbole werden angezeigt

**X-Achse:**:

* Zeigt Daten an, wobei der Zeitraum in der rechten oberen Ecke der Seite angepasst werden kann
* Die horizontale Linie über der Y-Achse stellt das Budget des Projekts dar. Diese Statuszeile passt sich an, wenn sich das Budget des Projekts ändert, einschließlich wöchentlicher, monatlicher oder jährlicher Aktualisierungen.

Falls das Projektbudget überschritten wird, wird die prognostizierte Linie über die geschätzte Budgetlinie hinaus fortgesetzt, wodurch anhaltende Ausgaben reflektiert werden.

# [ARTICLE] Bulk edit time entries for your team - Clockify Help
https://clockify.me/help/getting-started/bulk-edit-time-entries-for-your-team/

# Bulk edit time entries for your team - Clockify Help


## Chunk 1

One of the responsibilities of a Manager is to make sure that there is accurate and up-to-date time tracking for your team. If you manage a large volume of time entries, the **Bulk edit** feature will help you improve this process. Here’s how to make the most of this feature.

What is bulk edit? #
--------------------

**Bulk edit** allows you to update multiple time entries at once. Whether you’re adjusting tags, changing project details, or marking time entries as favorites, Bulk edit can save you time and ensure consistency across your team’s time tracking.

Access permissions for bulk edit #
----------------------------------

As a **Team manager** or **Project manager**, you have permission to bulk edit and bulk delete time entries. However, please note that **Admins** have the highest level of access and can configure workspace settings like required fields and general permissions. You’ll have full control over your team’s time entries but may need to coordinate with an Admin for certain settings.

How to bulk edit time entries #
-------------------------------

You can bulk edit time entries directly from the **Time tracker** page:

1. Go to the **Time tracker** page where your team’s daily time entries are recorded
2. Find the **edit icon** next to the total number of hours tracked for a specific day
3. Click the edit icon, and **bulk edit** will be enabled for that day


## Chunk 2

the **edit icon** next to the total number of hours tracked for a specific day
3. Click the edit icon, and **bulk edit** will be enabled for that day’s time entries

Once bulk edit is active, you can modify multiple time entries for that day at once.

### Update multiple time entries in the Detailed report #

To update time entries across a larger time range, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Detailed report
2. Use the checkboxes to select the time entries you want to edit
   You can also use **filters** to narrow down which time entries you want to modify (e.g. by project, user, or date)
3. After selecting the entries, click the **Bulk edit** button at the top of the table
4. You’ll be able to modify several fields, including:
   * Tags
   * Projects
   * Tasks
   * Description

For each field you want to update, choose the new values. For example: *Change the tags or assign the selected entries to a new project.*

Once you’re done, click **Save** to apply the updates to all selected time entries.

When updating time entries in bulk, you have two options for handling **tags**:

* Existing tags will be replaced with the new tag you select
* If you want to add a new tag **without replacing** the old one, check the **Add to existing** option. This will allow multiple tags to be assigned to the same time entry.

#### Mark time entries as favorites #

This feature is available with paid plans.

For easier access to frequently used time entries, you can **mark them as favorites**:

1. Use the checkboxes to select the time entries you want to mark as favorites
2. Choose the option to mark those entries as **favorites**
3. Save

This allows you to quickly access and track commonly used time entries in the **Time tracker**.

Additionally manage time entries #
----------------------------------

### Move time entries between workspaces #

This is a paid feature and requires the workspace to be upgraded.

If you need to transfer time entries from one workspace to another, you can do so using the **Import timesheet** feature:

* In the **Detailed report**, choose the date range and any necessary filters, then export the report as a **CSV** file
* Log into the destination workspace where you want to move the time entries
* Go to **Settings > Import** and upload the CSV file
* Follow the prompts to start the import process

### Delete time entries #

If you need to remove a time entry, follow these steps:

1. Select time entry
2. Click the three dots on the right side of the time entry you want to delete
3. Confirm by clicking **Delete**

If you accidentally delete a time entry, you can **undo** the action by follo


## Chunk 4

of the time entry you want to delete
3. Confirm by clicking **Delete**

If you accidentally delete a time entry, you can **undo** the action by following the steps below.

### Undo a deleted time entry #

If you are working in bulk and accidentally delete the wrong entry, you will be able to restore it with the **Undo** option.

If you delete a time entry by mistake, you can easily undo the action:

1. After you confirm the deletion, a **toast notification** will appear at the bottom of the screen with an **Undo** button
2. You have 10 seconds to undo the deletion

After you click **Undo,** the entry will be restored, including all data (e.g. project, tags, time spent).

Best practices  #
-----------------

* When working with a large number of entries, it’s helpful to filter your data by project, user, or date before selecting entries to edit. This ensures you only update the time entries you need to change.
* Bulk edits cannot be undone unless you use the **Undo** feature immediately. Always double-check the values you’re updating before saving to avoid mistakes.
* If you frequently use tags for categorizing time, ensure they’re consistently applied across your workspace.

Lista compacta de projetos #
----------------------------

Se você tiver centenas de clientes, projetos e tarefas e tiver dificuldades para encontrar o caminho certo para um projeto/tarefa específico e rastrear o tempo nela. Sendo assim, será conveniente ativar a lista compacta de projetos em suas Configurações pessoais.

A lista compacta de projetos recolhe todos os projetos de seu cliente, tornando a lista mais fácil de gerenciar.

Se seu projeto/cliente tiver um nome longo, você pode expandir a lista por toda a tela.

![complex project finder](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/complex-project-finder-min.png)

Projetos e tarefas favoritos #
------------------------------

Se houver alguns projetos e tarefas que você usa com frequência, você pode marcá-los como favoritos para que apareçam na parte superior do localizador de projetos.

Para usar os Projetos favoritos, você precisará ativá-los primeiro nas configurações do Espaço de trabalho. Para fazer isso, alterne em **Projetos favoritos** para **Projetos favoritos ativados**.

Você pode marcar um projeto como favorito na página Projetos clicando na estrela ao lado dele ou diretamente no localizador de projetos.

Os projetos favoritos são específicos do usuário. Quando você marca algum projeto como favorito, isso não afeta os outros usuários. Cada usuário pode ter seu próprio conjunto de projetos favoritos.


## Chunk 2

. Quando você marca algum projeto como favorito, isso não afeta os outros usuários. Cada usuário pode ter seu próprio conjunto de projetos favoritos.

Filtro de tarefas #
-------------------

Se você preferir filtrar primeiramente por projeto ou cliente, mantenha o filtro de tarefas desativado e o filtro levará em consideração:

* Nome do projeto
* Nome do cliente

No entanto, se você usa muitas tarefas ao rastrear o tempo, talvez queira ativar o filtro Tarefa. Esse filtro é específico do usuário, então cada usuário pode ativá-lo nas Configurações do perfil (aplicativo da web).

Uma vez selecionado, você pode encontrar rapidamente a tarefa (assim como o projeto e cliente) que está procurando usando a sintaxe “tarefa @projeto”:

1. Digite o nome da tarefa para encontrar a tarefa que você precisa
2. Filtre os resultados adicionando o prefixo @ e digitando projeto ou nome do cliente

## Chunk 1

See all your tracked time in a Calendar view so you can:

* See how your day looks like at glance and notice work patterns
* See if you have gaps in day where you forgot to log time
* See if you double booked time and have overlapping entries

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-20-at-14.33.10-1024x599.png)

View time #
-----------

Your each time entry will appear as a time block in the Calendar’s time slots.

Current day is marked as blue in the table header, and current time is indicated by the blue horizontal line.

Each time slot represents 1h, but you can zoom in using the plus sign in the upper left corner all the way down to 30/15/5 minute blocks.

You can hover over a time block to see full entry details, or click on the block to open the full view of the time entry.

Change the first day of the week in your Profile settings. This way, the week start that you set here will override the default one set by Owner/Admin in the Workspace settings.

View team member’s calendar #
-----------------------------

Admins and Team Managers can view other users’ calendars. This option is available with Add time for others paid feature.

To view a user’s calendar:

* Click on the Teammates picker at the top of the Calendar page
* Select a user from the list

at the top of the Calendar page
* Select a user from the list

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/calendar-view-other-users-1024x373.png)

Admins can select any active user in the workspace and Team Managers only users they manage.

If you are an admin, you can edit or add time for a team member directly in the calendar. This option is available if you update your workspace to any of our paid plans.

Add and edit time #
-------------------

You can edit time entries directly within the Calendar:

* Drag the start/end time edges of the time block to shorten/extend the entry
* Drag and drop the whole time block to move it to some other time slot (or date)
* Click on time entry to split running of already created entry

You can also add new time entries directly within the Calendar:

* Click on any open time slot to add a time entry
* Click and drag up or down to create a time entry for the desired time slot

Hold a left mouse click on a block to quickly make a copy of a time entry and drag and drop it to a desired time slot.

Please note that, if the start and end time include an overnight period, there will be a superscript number next to the end time, showing how many additional days the time entry covers.

If you are an admin, you can stop someone’s timer as well as edit/add time for a team member directly in the calendar. This option is available if you u

Show working days only #
------------------------

If you’d like to focus only on your workdays in your Calendar’s week view, the **Show working days only** switcher allows you to do that.

Every user, regardless of their user role can adjust their own Calendar settings.

### Turn on Show working days only #

This setting is off by default.

To turn it on:

1. Click on the **Settings icon** on your **Calendar** page
2. In the **Calendar settings** window, find the **Show working days only** option
3. Turn the switch on
4. Click **Close** to exit the screen

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2025-06-02-at-10.48.13-1.png)

Once turned on, your Calendar’s **Week** view will only display the days defined as working days in your workspace settings (or on your **Team** page profile). If you’re viewing another user’s calendar with this setting on, you’ll see their defined working days.

This setting doesn’t change the Day view, which always shows all days.

If the switch is turned on, and the user is looking at the non-working day in the calendar, by clicking on the week, they can see the working week of that day.

Connect to Google Calendar or Outlook #
---------------------------------------

Clockify can display events from Google Calendar or Outlook (Office 365), so you can compare side-by-side how you planned your day vs how it actually looked like (i.e. what you tracked), and create time entries based on calendar events.

To connect Google Calendar or Outlook:

1. Go to the Calendar page
2. Click on the settings icon (next to Teammates)
3. Click **Connect** for Google Calendar or Outlook
4. Authorize Clockify to access your calendar’s events

* Open the event directly in the external calendar

Each user needs to personally connect their calendar. Only you can see events from your connected calendar (admins and managers can’t see events from your connected calendar).

The data Clockify collects includes: event name, start and end time, and link to the event. Clockify has View-only access to the calendar (it can’t edit events).

Only cloud Outlook is supported (on-premise and hybrid versions are not supported at the moment).

Work with multiple calendars #
------------------------------

If you have multiple calendars, you can choose which ones you wish to see in Clockify.

If you wish to see events from other calendar accounts, you’ll need to add those calendars to your Google or Outlook account, and then they’ll get listed in the Clockify’s connect window, where you can enable them:

Disconnect Google Calendar or Outlook #
---------------------------------------

To disconnect


## Chunk 6

Clockify’s connect window, where you can enable them:

Disconnect Google Calendar or Outlook #
---------------------------------------

To disconnect the calendar, click on the connect button and then on the three dots, and you’ll see the Disconnect option.

You can also revoke Clockify’s access to Outlook by going to Outlook account > Manage your apps > Clockify > Remove permissions.

You can also revoke Clockify’s access to Google Calendar by going to your Google account > Security > Apps with access to your account > Remove access.

---------------

Chaque saisie de temps apparaîtra comme un bloc de temps dans les tranches de temps du calendrier.

Le jour actuel est marqué en bleu dans l'en-tête du tableau, et l'heure actuelle est indiquée par la ligne horizontale bleue.

Chaque tranche horaire représente 1h, mais vous pouvez zoomer en utilisant le signe plus dans le coin supérieur gauche jusqu'à des blocs de 30/15/5 minutes.

Vous pouvez survoler un bloc de temps pour voir les détails complets de la saisie, ou cliquer sur le bloc pour ouvrir l’affichage complet de la saisie de temps

Modifiez le premier jour de la semaine dans vos paramètres du profil. De cette façon, le début de semaine que vous définissez ici remplacera celui défini par défaut par le propriétaire/administrateur dans les paramètres de l'espace de travail.

## Chunk 1

Los campos de usuario te permiten añadir información adicional sobre los miembros del equipo (como el puesto de trabajo, fecha de inicio, empleo, teléfono, departamento, ID de empleado) y luego exportarla junto con las entradas de tiempo.

Esta es una función de pago que está disponible para los usuarios de planes **Pro** y **Enterprise**.

Crear campos de usuario #
-------------------------

Para crear un campo de usuario, ve a la **Configuración del espacio de trabajo** > **Campos personalizados** desplázate hasta la sección **Campos personalizados de usuario** y haz clic en **Crear**.

Primero, debes especificar el tipo de campo según el tipo de información que te gustaría añadir sobre el usuario.

* **Texto:** - campo de entrada para cualquier tipo de información (p. ej., ID de empleado, ubicación, fecha de inicio)
* **Número:** - campo de entrada para valores numéricos (p. ej., ID interno)
* **Enlace**- campo de entrada que acepta la URL a sitios web o archivos (p.ej., certificado, enlace de perfil)
* **Conmutador:** - un simple conmutador de sí/no (p.ej., de jornada parcial)
* **Selecciona:** - campo de entrada que permite a los usuarios seleccionar una sola opción de una lista predeterminada (p.ej., departamento)
* **Seleccionar varios:** - campo de entrada que permite a los usuarios seleccionar cualquier número de valores de una lista predeterminada (p.ej., elegibilidad


## Chunk 2

ionar varios:** - campo de entrada que permite a los usuarios seleccionar cualquier número de valores de una lista predeterminada (p.ej., elegibilidad)

Escribe un nombre, descripción, marcador de posición y selecciona valores (si los hay).

Una vez creado el campo, arrástralo a la columna Campos activos para que sea visible en los perfiles de usuarios.

El número máximo de campos de usuario creados es 50 y el número máximo de campos de usuario activos es 10.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/user-field-new-logo.png)

Aplicar campos de usuario #
---------------------------

Una vez creado y activado el campo de usuario, ve a la página de **Equipo** y haz clic en los tres puntos junto a algún usuario.

Cuando te desplaces hacia abajo, verás el campo de usuario que has creado y podrás establecer el valor para ese usuario.

Los valores de los campos de usuario se pueden introducir por **Propietarios** y **Administradores**.

e transmite a todos los usuarios del equipo (activos, inactivos e invitados).

Si en algún momento el valor predeterminado del **campo de usuario activo** cambia, entonces este nuevo valor se aplica solo a los nuevos usuarios (el valor predeterminado para los usuarios existentes no cambia).

Los campos de usuario se pueden arrastrar y soltar entre las columnas de
**Campos disponibles** y **Campos activos.**

Eliminar un campo de usuario elimina ese campo y todos sus datos de todos los miembros, en todo el espacio de trabajo. Una vez eliminado un campo, es como si jamás hubiera existido. Esta acción no se puede revertir.

Para conservar los datos, es mejor desactivar un campo personalizado moviéndolo a la columna de **Campos disponibles**.

-------------------------------

Cuando un usuario tiene algún campo de usuario rellenado, puedes obtener su valor al exportar los informes junto con las entradas de tiempo de ese usuario.

Para obtener los campos de usuario en CSV y Excel, primero tendrás que habilitarlos:

1. Ve al **Informe detallado**
2. Haz clic en **Exportar** y elige **Personalizar**

# Campos de usuário no Clockify


## Chunk 1

Os campos do usuário permitem acrescentar informações adicionais sobre os integrantes da equipe (como cargo, data de início, emprego, telefone, departamento, ID do funcionário) e, em seguida, exportá-los junto com as entradas de tempo.

Este é uma ferramenta paga e está disponível para usuários dos planos **Pro** e **Enterprise**.

Criar campos de usuário #
-------------------------

Para criar um campo de usuário, vá para **Configurações do espaço de trabalho** > **Campos personalizados**, role para baixo até a seção **Campos personalizados do usuário** e clique em  **Criar**.

Primeiro, você deve especificar o tipo de campo com base na informação que deseja adicionar sobre o usuário.

* **Texto** – campo de entrada para qualquer tipo de informação (ex.: ID do funcionário, localização, data de início)
* **Número** – campo de entrada para valores numéricos (ex.: registro interno)
* **Link**– campo de entrada que aceita a URL para sites ou arquivos (ex.: certificado, link de perfil)
* **Trocar** – um simples interruptor sim/não (ex.: meio período)
* **Selecionar** – campo de entrada que permite aos usuários selecionar uma única opção de uma lista predeterminada (ex.: departamento)
* **Selecionar vários** – campo de entrada que permite aos usuários selecionar qualquer número de valores de uma lista pré-determinada (ex.: elegibilidade)

Digite um nome, descrição, espaço reservado


## Chunk 2

ite aos usuários selecionar qualquer número de valores de uma lista pré-determinada (ex.: elegibilidade)

Digite um nome, descrição, espaço reservado e selecione valores (se houver).

Depois de criar um campo, arraste-o para a coluna Ativo para que fique visível nos perfis de usuário.

O número máximo de campos de usuário criados é 50 e o número máximo de campos de usuário ativos é 10.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/user-field-new-logo.png)

Aplicar campos de usuário #
---------------------------

Depois que o campo de usuário for criado e ativado, vá para a página **Equipe** e clique nos três pontos ao lado de qualquer usuário.

Ao rolar para baixo, você verá o campo de usuário que criou e poderá definir o valor para esse usuário.

Os valores dos campos de usuário podem ser inseridos pelos **Proprietários** e **Administradores**.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/define-user-field.png)

Editar e excluir campos de usuário #
------------------------------------

Se houver um valor definido para o campo de usuário, após arrastar e soltar esse campo na coluna **Campos ativos** , esse valor é passado para todos os usuários da equipe (ativos, inativos e convidados).

Se a qualquer momento o valor padrão do **Campo de Usuário ativo** for alterado, esse novo valor se aplica apenas a novos usuários (o valor padrão para usuários existente


## Chunk 3

o o valor padrão do **Campo de Usuário ativo** for alterado, esse novo valor se aplica apenas a novos usuários (o valor padrão para usuários existentes não é alterado).

Os campos do usuário podem ser arrastados e soltos entre **Campos disponíveis** e **Campos ativos.**

A eliminação de um campo de usuário exclui esse campo e todos os seus dados de todos os integrantes, em todo o espaço de trabalho. Depois que um campo é excluído, é como se nunca tivesse existido. Esta ação não pode ser revertida.

Para reter dados, é melhor desativar um campo personalizado movendo-o para a **coluna Disponível**.

Campos de usuário em relatórios #
---------------------------------

Quando um usuário tem campos de usuário preenchidos, você pode obter seu valor exportando os relatórios junto com as entradas de tempo deste usuário.

Para obter os campos de usuário em CSV e Excel, primeiro você precisa ativá-los:

1. Vá para o **Relatório detalhado**
2. Clique em **Exportar** e selecione **Personalizar**
3. Verifique os campos que deseja receber na exportação
4. Salve Configurações de exportação
5. Exporte o CSV ou Excel

Você pode filtrar relatórios por qualquer campo de usuário clicando na seta suspensa ao lado de Filtrar e marcando o filtro de campo de usuário (somente os campos ativos são mostrados). Em seguida, selecione o valor que deseja filtrar e clique em **Aplicar filtro**.

# [ARTICLE] Campos obrigatórios no Clockify
https://clockify.me/help/pt/track-time-and-expenses/required-fields/

# Campos obrigatórios no Clockify


## Chunk 1

Campos obrigatórios
===================

Você pode impedir que os usuários adicionem entradas de tempo incompletas usando campos obrigatórios. Isso garantirá que todas as entradas de tempo tenham uma quantidade mínima obrigatória de informações atribuídas a elas, para que seus relatórios sejam organizados e precisos o tempo todo.

Os campos obrigatórios são uma ferramenta paga, que você pode ativar atualizando
 seu espaço de trabalho para qualquer um dos planos pagos.

Como ativar os campos obrigatórios #
------------------------------------

Nas Configurações do espaço de trabalho, os administradores podem definir quais campos em uma entrada de tempo são obrigatórios antes que a entrada possa ser criada.

Estes são os campos que você poderá tornar obrigatório:

* Projeto
* Tarefa
* Etiqueta
* Descrição

Quando a tarefa é um campo obrigatório, os projetos que não têm tarefas não aparecem no seletor de projetos.

Como funciona #
---------------

Por exemplo, se você marcar projetos e etiquetas como campo obrigatório:

* Ninguém poderá adicionar uma entrada de tempo sem um projeto e etiqueta (nem mesmo administradores)
* O cronômetro pode ser iniciado, mas não pode ser interrompido até que você adicione um projeto e uma etiqueta
* A planilha de horas não permitirá que você adicione tempo sem selecionar uma etiqueta

## Chunk 1

Añade campos adicionales a las entradas de tiempo y rastrea cualquier cosa.

Con los campos personalizados, puedes seguir manualmente: gastos, kilometraje, descansos, horas extras, estado de facturación, número de unidades, desplegables personalizados, cantidad, códigos, ubicación, equipamiento, estimación, número de acuerdo, enlace al ticket, recibos, imágenes, todo tipo de identificaciones (factura, tarea, usuario, proyecto)...

Además de los datos del usuario, puedes rastrear los metadatos del proyecto - perfecto cuando necesitas analizar los datos en las tablas dinámicas o cuando necesitas integrar Clockify con sistemas externos a través de la API.

Si quieres añadir campos personalizados a los usuarios (como el ID del empleado), puedes usar campos de usuario.

Los campos personalizados son una función de pago, que puedes habilitar una vez al actualizar tu espacio de trabajo al plan Pro o Enterprise.

Los usuarios pueden introducir los datos en los campos personalizados a través de la web, extensión de navegador, iOS, Android y Mac y Windows.

Para una guía general sobre los campos personalizados, ve el siguiente vídeo y sigue las instrucciones a continuación.

ares introduzcan o modifiquen los datos configurando **Quién puede editar: Administradores** (por ejemplo, puedes tener un estado No pagado/Pagado que los usuarios pueden ver, pero que solo los administradores pueden cambiar).

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/custom-fiedl-new.png)

Usar campos #
-------------

Para que tus usuarios puedan ver y usar los campos que has creado, arrastra y suelta el campo al espacio Visible en la columna de Campos activos. Entonces, los campos aparecerán en el Rastreador de tiempo y en la Planilla de horarios para todos en el espacio de trabajo.

En Planilla de horarios, puedes introducir datos para los campos adicionales cuando pasas el cursor encima de una celda con tiempo y haces clic en los tres puntos.

Puedes tener hasta 5 campos visibles para todo el espacio de trabajo, junto con 5 más en los proyectos.

Los campos funcionan como entradas normales, dependiendo del tipo de campo que hayas especificado. Los usuarios pueden introducir texto, número, marcar casillas de verificación o seleccionar de una lista de valores predeterminados.

**Cuándo utilizar campos invisibles**

Los campos invisibles son útiles cuando necesitas integrar Clockify con sistemas externos a través de la API, o necesitas que las entradas hereden metadatos adicionales de los proyectos (como el identificador del proyecto o el tipo de proyecto) y no


## Chunk 4

e la API, o necesitas que las entradas hereden metadatos adicionales de los proyectos (como el identificador del proyecto o el tipo de proyecto) y no quieres sobrecargar a tus usuarios con datos irrelevantes.

Si activas un campo y lo haces invisible, los usuarios no verán el campo en ninguna parte, pero todas las entradas creadas lo tendrán. Las entradas pueden heredar el valor de los campos invisibles a través del proyecto o las puedes actualizar a través de la API o alguna integración.

Los campos invisibles y sus datos aparecen en la exportación de Excel y CSV del Informe detallado.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/custom-field-usage.png)

Configurar campos en proyectos #
--------------------------------

Además de activar los campos personalizados para todo el espacio de trabajo, también puedes activarlos según el proyecto y anular la visibilidad y el valor predeterminado en la configuración del proyecto.

Todos los campos invisibles aparecen en los proyectos automáticamente. Puedes establecer su valor predeterminado para ese proyecto, además de hacerlos visibles (o invisibles) cuando un usuario selecciona ese proyecto.

Puedes tener hasta 10 campos visibles en un proyecto.

Además de gestionar los campos activos, también puedes añadir un campo desde una lista de campos disponibles, para que solo las entradas en ese proyecto en particular tengan ese


## Chunk 5

pos activos, también puedes añadir un campo desde una lista de campos disponibles, para que solo las entradas en ese proyecto en particular tengan ese campo.

Si quieres que los campos tengan algún valor predeterminado cuando un usuario selecciona un proyecto, por ejemplo, si un usuario selecciona ProyectoX, un campo de **Ubicación** se puede establecer como **España**, que el usuario puede anular más tarde si no es **España**.

Cuidado con los valores predeterminados puesto que siempre anulan los valores existentes.
Por ejemplo, si una entrada de tiempo tiene **Mi valor** y luego tú cambias un proyecto con un **Valor predeterminado**, esto sobrescribirá **Mi valor** (puedes volver a introducir **Mi valor**, pero si cambias de nuevo el proyecto de una entrada de tiempo, **Mi valor** se perderá).

Un gerente de proyecto puede anular la visibilidad de un campo y establecer un valor predeterminado para su proyectos.

Uso avanzado #
--------------

Puedes conseguir cualquier flujo de trabajo que necesites utilizando los siguientes cuatro mecanismos:

* **Permiso de edición** - Puedes permitir que los usuarios editen los datos de un campo para sus entradas de tiempo, o limitar la edición solo a los administradores
* **Visibilidad** - Afecta a si los usuarios pueden ver un campo en el Rastreador de tie


## Chunk 6

as de tiempo, o limitar la edición solo a los administradores
* **Visibilidad** - Afecta a si los usuarios pueden ver un campo en el Rastreador de tiempo y en la Planilla de horarios
* **Valor predeterminado** - Los campos en las entradas de tiempo empiezan vacíos a menos que los rellenes de antemano con un valor predeterminado
* **Anulación de proyectos** - Puedes anular la visibilidad de un campo y el valor predeterminado por proyecto

Por ejemplo, puedes seleccionar un campo como no editable por los usuarios regulares y visible solo en ciertos proyectos. O, puedes hacer que un campo sea invisible y seleccionar un valor predeterminado en los proyectos para que cada entrada de tiempo tenga sus metadatos de proyecto.

| EDITAR | VISIBILIDAD | PREDETERMINACIÓN | CASO DE USO |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Todos | Visible | Vacía | **Para la entrada del usuario** Un usuario ve un campo de entrada e introduce un valor (p. ej., kilometraje, gastos, recibos) |
| Todos | Visible | Heredada | **Para la anulación del usuario si es necesario** Un usuario ve un campo de entrada con un valor pre-rellenado, que puede cambiar si hace falta (ej. seleccionar un valor diferente) |
| Todos | Invisible | Vacía | **Para la integración del usuario** Las entradas tienen ese campo con el valor vacío, que se puede actualizar solo a través de la API |
| Todos | Invisible | Heredada | **Para los metadato


## Chunk 7

s entradas tienen ese campo con el valor vacío, que se puede actualizar solo a través de la API |
| Todos | Invisible | Heredada | **Para los metadatos de los proyectos** Todas las entradas heredan los metadatos del espacio de trabajo o proyecto (ej. nombre del espacio de trabajo, identificación del proyecto) |
| Administradores | Visible | Vacía | **Para el seguimiento del estado del usuario** Los administradores editan las entradas de tiempo de los demás para que los usuarios luego puedan ver el estado de sus entradas (ej. el administrador indica que el tiempo fue pagado) |
| Administradores | Visible | Heredada | **Para la referencia del usuario** Las entradas muestran a los usuarios la información del proyecto con fines de referencia |
| Administradores | Invisible | Vacía | **Para las integraciones de administradores** Las entradas tienen un campo con un valor vacío, que se puede actualizar solo por administradores a través de la API |
| Administradores | Invisible | Heredada | **Para los metadatos de los proyectos de administradores** Los metadatos del espacio de trabajo o del proyecto, que solo los administradores pueden anular a través de la API (ej. nombre del espacio de trabajo, identificación de proyecto) |

### Campo personalizado obligatorio #

También puedes configurar que un campo personalizado de entrada de tiempo sea obligatorio para cada entrada de tiempo a ni


## Chunk 8

ersonalizado obligatorio #

También puedes configurar que un campo personalizado de entrada de tiempo sea obligatorio para cada entrada de tiempo a nivel de espacio de trabajo.
Para hacer eso, un campo personalizado de entrada de tiempo debe establecerse como **Visible** con un valor predeterminado, o ser editado por **Todos**. Si se configura correctamente, este campo personalizado aparecerá en la configuración del espacio de trabajo, en la sección **No permitir guardar tiempo sin**, en la pestaña **General**. Después de seleccionar una casilla de verificación, el campo aparecerá en un Rastreador y Planilla de horarios como un campo **obligatorio**.

Así que, la próxima vez que un usuario quiera introducir una entrada de tiempo, tendrá que introducir los datos en este campo obligatorio.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-17-at-16.55.40-1024x86.png)

Editar y eliminar campos #
--------------------------

Activar un campo no afecta a las entradas antiguas. Solo las nuevas entradas de tiempo en adelante tendrán campos personalizados y valores predeterminados. Para añadir campos a las entradas de tiempo retroactivamente, tendrás que actualizar las entradas de tiempo manualmente.

Si mueves un campo de Activo a Disponible, las nuevas entradas dejarán de tener ese campo, pero las entradas existentes conservarán sus datos y aparecerán en las e


## Chunk 9

campo de Activo a Disponible, las nuevas entradas dejarán de tener ese campo, pero las entradas existentes conservarán sus datos y aparecerán en las exportaciones.

Eliminar un campo personalizado elimina ese campo y todos sus datos de todas las entradas de tiempo, en todo el espacio de trabajo. Una vez al eliminar un campo, es como si jamás hubiera existido. No se puede deshacer. Para conservar los datos, lo mejor es desactivarlo moviendo el campo a la columna de Disponible.

Si editas las opciones de un campo de tipo **Selecciona:** , las entradas existentes conservarán sus valores originales. A menos que:

* Cambies manualmente el valor del campo personalizado de tipo **Selecciona:** en la entrada de tiempo a un valor diferente
* Cambies el proyecto de la entrada de tiempo a un proyecto que tenga un valor predeterminado establecido para este campo de tipo Seleccionar. En este caso, la entrada obtendrá el valor predeterminado para el campo personalizado de tipo **Selecciona:** . En este caso, la entrada obtendrá el valor predeterminado para el campo personalizado de tipo **Selecciona:** del proyecto que hayas seleccionado.

### Ejemplo de edición de campo #

Digamos que tienes un campo personalizado de tipo **Selecciona:** llamado **Ubicación** con tres opciones de selección: **Madrid**, **Barcelona**, y **Bilbao**.

Tú creas una entrada de tiempo y seleccionas **Madrid** com


## Chunk 10

do **Ubicación** con tres opciones de selección: **Madrid**, **Barcelona**, y **Bilbao**.

Tú creas una entrada de tiempo y seleccionas **Madrid** como tu ubicación. Entonces vas a la Configuración del espacio de trabajo y cambias el nombre de la opción **Madrid** por **Sevilla**.

La entrada creada mantendrá el valor **Madrid**.

Si editas la entrada creada y cambias su proyecto a uno que tenga el valor predeterminado para el campo de Ubicación (por ejemplo, Barcelona) la entrada ahora tendrá **Barcelona** seleccionado como ubicación. En otras palabras, el valor predeterminado sobrescribirá el valor original cada vez que actualices una entrada.

Otro ejemplo: digamos que creas un campo llamado **Actualizado**, estableces el valor predeterminado **2020**, y lo haces invisible. Tus entradas antiguas no tendrán ese campo, pero cada entrada en adelante lo tendrá.

Si alguien cambia el proyecto en su entrada antigua, esa entrada recogerá el valor de **2020** aunque nunca lo haya tenido, lo que te permitirá ver si alguna entrada ha sido alterada.

Campos personalizados en informes #
-----------------------------------

Puedes recuperar las entradas de tiempo con todos sus campos y datos en el Informe detallado a través de la exportación de Excel y CSV. Luego, puedes crear todo tipo de informes personalizados en las tablas dinámicas.

Puedes ver y editar los datos de los campos visib


## Chunk 11

n de Excel y CSV. Luego, puedes crear todo tipo de informes personalizados en las tablas dinámicas.

Puedes ver y editar los datos de los campos visibles directamente en el Informe detallado. Adicionalmente, los administradores pueden editar los datos de los campos personalizados que otros usuarios han ingresado (los miembros regulares solo pueden editar y eliminar las entradas de tiempo que les pertenecen).

You can also use Bulk Edit to update Custom fields on multiple time entries with one click.

La exportación de Excel y CSV muestra todos los campos personalizados. Si alguna entrada de tiempo tiene algún valor en un campo personalizado que ya no está activo ni en el espacio de trabajo ni en algún proyecto, ese campo no aparecerá.

Descarga un informe de muestra (Excel)

Los informes también te permiten filtrar el informe por campos personalizados. Puedes activar o desactivar fácilmente cuáles campos personalizados quieres ver como filtros y usarlos al filtrar las entradas de tiempo.

Estos filtros son específicos del usuario. Cuando añades algunos campos personalizados a los filtros, esto no afecta a otros usuarios. Cada usuario puede tener su propia colección de filtros.

--------------------------------

Puedes importar todos los campos personalizados obligatorios **Activos**, **Visibles** e **Invisibles** desde un archivo CSV. De esta manera, los informes pueden reflejar todo el tiempo registrado específico a tu caso de uso.

Los campos personalizados pueden importarse solo como parte de un archivo CSV que contiene entradas de tiempo.

# Campos personalizados no Clockify


## Chunk 1

Adicione campos às entradas de tempo e rastreie qualquer trabalho!

Com campos personalizados, você pode rastrear manualmente: despesas, quilometragem, pausas, horas extras, estado da fatura, número de produtos, listas suspensas, quantidades, códigos, localizações, equipamentos, estimativas, número de acordos, link para o convite, recibos, imagens, todos os tipos de IDs (fatura, tarefa, usuário, projeto)… e muito mais!

Além dos dados do usuário, você também pode rastrear metadados do projeto – perfeito quando você precisa analisar dados em tabelas dinâmicas ou quando precisa integrar o Clockify com sistemas externos via API.

Se desejar adicionar campos personalizados aos usuários (como ID do funcionário), você pode usar campos de usuário.

Os campos personalizados é uma ferramenta paga, que você pode ativar atualizando seu espaço de trabalho para o plano Pro ou Enterprise.

Os usuários podem inserir dados em campos personalizados via: web, extensão do navegador, iOS, Android, Mac e Windows.

Para obter uma orientação geral sobre campos personalizados, assista ao vídeo e siga as instruções abaixo.

A interface do usuário exibida neste vídeo pode não corresponder à versão mais recente do aplicativo.

## Chunk 2

Você pode criar campos personalizados em Configurações do Espaço de Trabalho > aba Campos personalizados. Você pode ter até 50 campos em um espaço de trabalho.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/custom-field-interface.png)

Ao criar um campo, você precisa especificar:

* **Texto** – campo de entrada onde você pode digitar o que quiser (nome do projeto, observações adicionais, coordenadas)
* **Número** – campo de entrada que aceita apenas valores numéricos (quilometragem, despesas, número de unidades)
* **Link**– campo de entrada que aceita URL de sites ou arquivos (recibos, capturas de tela, documentos, referência de tarefas)
* **Trocar** – um simples botão para marcar sim ou não em uma tarefa (faturado, pago, urgente)
* **Selecionar** – campo de entrada que permite aos usuários selecionar uma única opção de uma lista pré-determinada (local, status, categoria)
* **Selecionar vários** – campo de entrada que permite aos usuários selecionar mais de uma opção de uma lista pré-determinada (equipamento usado, lista de etiquetas personalizadas para um projeto)

Você também pode impedir que usuários regulares insiram ou alterem dados pelas configurações **Quem pode editar: Administradores** (por exemplo, você pode ter uma situação Pendente/Pago que os usuários podem ver, mas apenas os administradores podem alterar).

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/custom-fiedl-new.png)

Usar campos #
-------------

Para que seus usuários vejam e usem os campos que você criou, arraste e solte o campo no espaço Visível na coluna Ativa. Em seguida, os campos serão exibidos no Rastreador e na Planilha de horas para todos do espaço de trabalho.

Na Planilha de horas, você pode inserir dados para os campos adicionais ao passar o mouse sobre uma célula com hora e clicar nos três pontos.

Você pode ter até 5 campos visíveis para todo o espaço de trabalho, além de mais 5 em projetos.

Os campos funcionam como entradas regulares, dependendo do tipo de campo que você especificou. Os usuários podem inserir texto, número, marcar uma caixa de seleção ou selecionar a partir de uma lista de valores predeterminados.

**Quando usar campos invisíveis**

Os campos invisíveis são úteis quando você precisa integrar o Clockify a sistemas externos via API ou precisa de entradas para receber metadados adicionais de projetos (como ID do projeto ou tipo de projeto) e não deseja sobrecarregar seus usuários com dados irrelevantes.

á-lo invisível, os usuários não verão o campo em nenhum lugar, mas terão todas as entradas criadas. As entradas podem herdar valor para campos invisíveis via projeto, ou você pode atualizá-las via API ou alguma integração.

Os campos invisíveis e seus dados aparecem no Excel e na exportação em CSV do Relatório detalhado.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/custom-field-usage.png)

Definir campos em projetos #
----------------------------

Além de ativar campos personalizados para todo o espaço de trabalho, você também pode ativá-los por projeto, bem como substituir a visibilidade e o valor padrão nas configurações do projeto.

Todos os campos invisíveis aparecem automaticamente nos projetos. Você pode definir o valor padrão para esse projeto, além de torná-los visíveis (ou invisíveis) quando um usuário selecionar esse projeto.

Você pode ter até 10 campos visíveis em um projeto.

Além de gerenciar campos ativos, você também pode adicionar um campo de uma lista de campos disponíveis, de modo que somente as entradas desse projeto específico tenham esse campo.

Os campos podem ter algum valor padrão quando um usuário selecionar um projeto. Por exemplo, se um usuário selecionar ProjectX, o campo **Local** poderá ser definido como **EUA** e o usuário poderá substituí-lo posteriormente para outra localização,
**EUA**.

Tenha cuidado com os valores padrão, pois el


## Chunk 5

er definido como **EUA** e o usuário poderá substituí-lo posteriormente para outra localização,
**EUA**.

Tenha cuidado com os valores padrão, pois eles sempre substituem os valores existentes.
*Por exemplo, se uma entrada de tempo tiver **Meu Valor** e você alterar um projeto com um **Valor Padrão**, ele substituirá **Meu Valor** (você pode inserir **Meu Valor** novamente, mas se alterar o projeto de uma entrada de tempo novamente, **Meu Valor** será perdido).*

Um gerente de projeto pode sobrepor a visibilidade de um campo e definir um valor padrão para seus projetos.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/custom-field-project.png)

Uso avançado #
--------------

Você pode obter qualquer fluxo de trabalho que precisar usando estes quatro mecanismos:

* **Permissão de edição** – Você pode permitir que os usuários editem dados em um campo para suas entradas de tempo ou limitar a edição apenas aos administradores
* **Visibilidade** – Influência se os usuários podem ver um campo no Rastreador de Tempo e na Planilha de Horas
* **Valor padrão** – Os campos nas entradas de tempo começam vazios, a menos que você os preencha com algum valor
* **Substituições de projeto** – Você pode substituir a visibilidade de um campo e o valor padrão por projeto

Por exemplo, você pode definir um campo como não editável por usuários comuns e visível apenas em alguns projetos. Ou v

e o valor padrão por projeto

Por exemplo, você pode definir um campo como não editável por usuários comuns e visível apenas em alguns projetos. Ou você pode tornar alguns campos invisíveis e definir um valor padrão nos projetos para que cada entrada de tempo tenha seus metadados de projeto.

| EDITAR | VISIBILIDADE | PADRÃO | COMO UTILIZAR |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Todos | Visível | Vazio | **Para entrada do usuário** Um usuário vê um campo de entrada e insere um valor (por exemplo: quilometragem, despesas, recibos) |
| Todos | Visível | Obtém | **Para os usuários substituírem, se necessário** Um usuário vê um campo de entrada com um valor pré-preenchido, que pode ser alterado se necessário (por exemplo: selecione um valor diferente) |
| Todos | Invisível | Vazio | **Para integrações de usuário** As entradas possuem esse campo com um valor vazio, que pode ser atualizado apenas via API |
| Todos | Invisível | Obtém | **Para os metadados do projeto** Todas as entradas recebem metadados de um espaço de trabalho ou projeto (por exemplo, nome do espaço de trabalho, ID do projeto) |

| Os administradores | Invisível | Vazio | **Para integrações administrativas** As entradas possuem campos com valores vazios, que podem ser atualizados somente por administradores via API |
| Os administradores | Invisível | Obtém | **Para metadados do projeto de administrador** Metadados do espaço de trabalho ou do projeto, que somente os administradores podem modificar via API (por exemplo, nome do espaço de trabalho, ID do projeto) |

### Campo personalizado obrigatório #

Você também pode definir um campo personalizado de entrada de tempo como obrigatório para cada entrada de tempo em um nível de espaço de trabalho.
Para fazer isso, um campo personalizado de entrada de tempo precisa ser definido como **Visível** com um valor padrão ou editado porv **Todos**. e configurado corretamente, esse campo personalizado aparecerá nas configurações do espaço de trabalho, na seção **Não permitir salvar tempo sem** na guia **Geral**. Depois de selecionado, o campo aparecerá em um Rastreador de tempo e Planilha de horas como um campo **obrigatório**.

Portanto, da próxima vez que um usuário desejar inserir uma entrada de


## Chunk 8

em um Rastreador de tempo e Planilha de horas como um campo **obrigatório**.

Portanto, da próxima vez que um usuário desejar inserir uma entrada de tempo, ele precisará inserir os dados neste campo obrigatório.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-17-at-16.55.40-1024x86.png)

Editar e excluir campos #
-------------------------

Ativar um campo não afeta entradas mais antigas. Somente as novas entradas de tempo terão campos personalizados e valores padrão. Para adicionar campos retroativos às entradas de tempo, você terá que atualizar manualmente as entradas de tempo.

Se você mover um campo de Ativo para Disponível, as novas entradas deixarão de ter esse campo, mas as entradas existentes manterão seus dados e aparecerão nas exportações.

Deletar um campo personalizado eliminará todos os dados de todas as entradas de tempo, em todo o espaço de trabalho. Depois de excluir um campo, é como se ele nunca tivesse existido. Não dá mais para recuperar os dados, então, para retê-los, é melhor desativá-los movendo o campo para a coluna Disponível.

Se você editar as opções de um campo do tipo **Selecionar** as entradas de tempo existentes manterão os valores originais. A não ser que:

* Você altere manualmente o valor do campo personalizado **Selecionar** na entrada de hora para um valor diferente
* Você altere o projeto da entrada de horas para u


## Chunk 9

anualmente o valor do campo personalizado **Selecionar** na entrada de hora para um valor diferente
* Você altere o projeto da entrada de horas para um projeto que tem um valor padrão definido para este campo **Selecionar** . Nesse caso, a entrada obterá o valor padrão para o campo personalizado **Selecionar** do projeto que você selecionou.

### Editar campo personalizado – exemplo #

Digamos que você tenha um campo personalizado do tipo **Selecionar** chamado **Localização** com 3 opções: **Los Angeles**, **Nova Iorque**, e **Boston**.

Você cria uma entrada de horário e seleciona **Los Angeles** como sua localização. Então você vai para as configurações do espaço de trabalho e renomeia a opção **Los Angeles** para **São Francisco**.

A entrada criada manterá o valor **Los Angeles**.

Se você editar a sua entrada e depois quiser alterar seu projeto para que tenha um valor padrão no campo Localização (por exemplo, **Nova Iorque** ), a entrada agora terá Nova York definida como Localização. Em outras palavras, o valor padrão substituirá o valor original sempre que você atualizar uma entrada.

Outro exemplo: digamos que você crie um campo chamado **Atualizado**, defina o valor padrão **2020** e o torne invisível. Suas entradas antigas não terão esse campo, mas cada entrada futura o terá.

Se alguém alterar o projeto em sua entrada antiga, esse valor será atualizado para o valor


## Chunk 10

gas não terão esse campo, mas cada entrada futura o terá.

Se alguém alterar o projeto em sua entrada antiga, esse valor será atualizado para o valor de **2020** permitindo que você veja se alguma entrada foi adulterada.

Campos personalizados em relatórios #
-------------------------------------

Você pode recuperar entradas de tempo com todas suas informações no Relatório Detalhado via exportação Excel e CSV. Assim, você pode criar relatórios personalizados em tabelas dinâmicas.

Você pode ver e editar os dados dos campos visíveis diretamente no relatório Detalhado. Além disso, os administradores podem editar os dados de campos personalizados que outros usuários inseriram (funcionários regulares só podem editar e excluir entradas de tempo que lhes pertençam).

You can also use Bulk Edit to update Custom fields on multiple time entries with one click.

A exportação de Excel e CSV lista todos os campos ativos. Se alguma entrada tiver algum valor em algum campo personalizado que não está mais ativo em nenhum espaço de trabalho nem em algum projeto, esse campo não aparecerá.

Baixar relatório de exemplo (Excel)

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/detailed-report-pivot-custom-fields-3.png)

## Chunk 11

ermitem que você filtre o relatório por campos personalizados. Você pode ativar ou desativar facilmente quais campos personalizados deseja ver como filtros e usá-los ao filtrar as entradas de tempo.

Esses filtros são específicos do usuário. Quando você adiciona alguns campos personalizados a filtros, isso não afeta outros usuários. Cada usuário pode ter seu próprio conjunto de filtros.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/custom-fields-wr-1024x433.png)

Importar campos personalizados #
--------------------------------

Você pode importar todos os campos personalizados obrigatórios **Ativos**, **Visíveis** e **Invisíveis** de um arquivo CSV. Dessa forma, os relatórios podem refletir todo o tempo rastreado específico para o seu caso de uso.

Campos personalizados só podem ser importados como parte de um arquivo CSV que inclua entradas de tempo.

Para importar seu arquivo CSV:

1. Navegue até o nome do espaço de trabalho no canto superior esquerdo
2. Abra o menu
3. Acesse as **configurações do espaço de trabalho**

# Campos requeridos en Clockify


## Chunk 1

Campos obligatorios
===================

Puedes impedir que los usuarios añadan entradas de tiempo incompletas con campos obligatorios. Esto garantizará que todas las entradas de tiempo tengan un mínimo obligatorio de la información asignada, para que tus informes sean organizados y exactos en todo momento.

Los campos obligatorios son una función de pago que puedes activar actualizando tu espacio de trabajo a cualquier plan de pago.

Cómo activar campos obligatorios #
----------------------------------

En la página de Configuración del espacio de trabajo, los administradores pueden definir qué campos de una entrada de tiempo son obligatorios antes de que se pueda crear la entrada de tiempo.

Puedes hacer que estos campos sean obligatorios:

* Proyecto
* Tarea
* Etiqueta
* Descripción

Cuando la tarea es un campo obligatorio, los proyectos sin tareas no aparecen en el selector de proyectos.

Cómo funciona #
---------------

Por ejemplo, si marcas proyecto y etiquetas como obligatorios:

* Nadie puede añadir una entrada de tiempo sin un proyecto y una etiqueta (ni siquiera los administradores)
* El temporizador se puede iniciar, pero no se puede detener hasta que añadas un proyecto y etiqueta
* Planilla horaria no te dejará añadir tiempo sin seleccionar una etiqueta

## Chunk 1

Can I merge workspaces?
=======================

Each workspace is treated as a separate entity with its own users, projects, and data. This means there’s no built-in option to directly combine two or more workspaces into one.

However, if you’d like to move data from one workspace to another, you can do so manually by exporting and importing data using CSV files.

How to move data between workspaces #

## Chunk 1

Can I restrict API key access?
==============================

Currently, **Clockify** does not offer the ability to restrict API keys to **read-only** access for specific workspaces. The permissions available through the API are tied to the user’s role in the workspace.

Whatever actions a user can perform in the Clockify UI, they can also perform using their API key. This means there’s no way to create a key with limited permissions or restricted access to certain workspace data.

## Chunk 1

Est-il possible de limiter l’accès à la clé API ?
=================================================

Actuellement, **Clockify** n’offre pas la possibilité de restreindre les clés API à un accès **en lecture seule** pour des espaces de travail spécifiques. Les autorisations disponibles via l’API sont liées au rôle de l’utilisateur dans l’espace de travail.

Toutes les actions qu’un utilisateur peut effectuer dans l’interface utilisateur de Clockify, il peut également les effectuer en utilisant sa clé API. Cela signifie qu’il n’y a aucun moyen de créer une clé avec des permissions limitées ou un accès restreint à certaines données de l’espace de travail.

Posso restringir o acesso à chave de API?
=========================================

Atualmente, o  **Clockify**  não oferece a possibilidade de restringir chaves de API para acesso **somente leitura** em espaços de trabalho específicos. As permissões disponíveis por meio da API estão vinculadas à função do usuário no espaço de trabalho.

Quaisquer ações que um usuário possa executar na interface do Clockify, ele também pode executar usando sua chave de API. Isso significa que não há como criar uma chave com permissões limitadas ou acesso restrito a determinados dados do espaço de trabalho.

## Chunk 1

Can’t change the client currency
================================

If you’re trying to change the currency for a client but don’t see any options in the dropdown, it’s likely because no additional currencies have been added yet.

How to change client currency #
-------------------------------

1. Navigate to the Clients page from the sidebar
2. Click on the pen icon next to the Client you want to edit
3. In the pop-up window, scroll down to the button and click on the Currency dropdown
4. Select the desired currency and save changes

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AD_4nXfK4UD0171_NuWzk5tzNdumqV5jZi2hyQ3kK-nGsVqR1bWWJpWBRIX_tlvhqxMbO8sJftc8L364vPRIs_F-Q_nMZ7L9cfFXAtD60pOsP6gWXaey-EnU_yYp54W9qV_CL7YDZoh9.png)

If the dropdown is empty, it means no other currencies have been created yet.

How to add currencies to the workspace #
----------------------------------------

To assign different currencies to clients, you’ll need to first create those currencies in your Workspace Settings. Only then will they appear as options when editing a client.

To add new currencies to your workspace:

1. Click on the three dots next to the Workspace name at the top of the page
2. Select “Workspace settings”
3. Scroll a bit down and click on “Edit” under the Currencies section
4. Select “Add currency”
5. Enter the currency abbreviation (e.g., EUR, GBP, CAD) and save

## Chunk 2

own and click on “Edit” under the Currencies section
4. Select “Add currency”
5. Enter the currency abbreviation (e.g., EUR, GBP, CAD) and save

After that, go back to the Clients page and edit the client again. The new currency options will now be available in the dropdown.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AD_4nXdWDsa0LyTN7e1xk3kTYg5TG45RekwFXxQ0A93lPddGyQ_vcM2fzfDFYZepDC6jj1j-y0MbqOj2ClWZHrlo-UCGKhkler5D08EuFC2P8NmVLbyNQGD85BIpC4KxypnX8ZYqXfOC.png)

Once the client’s currency is updated, all projects assigned to that client will automatically apply the selected currency for budgeting and invoicing.

https://clockify.me/help/fr/track-time-and-expenses/categorizing-time-entries/

# Catégorisation du temps et balises - Centre d'aide Clockify


## Chunk 1

Clockify vous permet de catégoriser et d'analyser le temps en utilisant une hiérarchie à 4 niveaux : description, tâches, projets et clients.

Pour une catégorisation plus poussée, vous pouvez également utiliser des balises, qui fonctionnent indépendamment de la hiérarchie.

Si vous souhaitez catégoriser le temps différemment, vous pouvez renommer les balises de projet, de client et de tâche en quelque chose d'autre.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/organization-schema-in-clockify.png)

Comment organiser les saisies de temps #
----------------------------------------

* **If you do client work**, name projects with the title of the assignment given by your client (e.g. “E-commerce Analytics”, “Website Redesign”, “SuperApp”). You can also have a special project where you’ll put all non-billable time entries (e.g. emails, time-off, meetings).
* **If you do client work but want to keep it simple**, you can just use client’s name as the project name and then use tasks to indicate what type of service you’ve provided (you can also change the **project** label to say **client** instead).
* **If you have common projects for different clients**, you can use projects for the type of service (e.g. marketing, development) and use tags to indicate for which client a particular time entry was.
* **If you don’t work with clients**, you can use projects as general area


## Chunk 2

ent) and use tags to indicate for which client a particular time entry was.
* **If you don’t work with clients**, you can use projects as general areas of work (e.g. sales, operations, support).
* **If you use Clockify for tracking personal productivity**, you can name projects by activity (e.g. emails, working, learning, cooking).

Clients, projets et tâches #
----------------------------

Les projets sont le principal moyen d'organiser votre temps dans Clockify. À un niveau supérieur, vous pouvez organiser les projets selon les clients (ou les départements ou tout autre élément).  En savoir plus sur la gestion des projets.

Les clients sont utilisés pour organiser les projets. Un client peut avoir plusieurs projets, mais un projet ne peut appartenir qu'à un seul client.

Il n'est pas possible d'ajouter un seul client à une entrée de temps, car les clients sont utilisés comme mécanisme de regroupement des projets. Cependant, vous pouvez créer un projet portant le nom d'un client. Vous pouvez également créer une balise pour chaque client et l'ajouter à une entrée de temps, afin de pouvoir ensuite regrouper les entrées par balise.

If you need more control, you can further classify time entries using tasks (i.e. sub-projects or jobs) and use them to designate the type of work (e.g. design, writing, programming), or whatever else you want (e.g. bugs, sprint A, phase X).

Alors qu


## Chunk 3

s) and use them to designate the type of work (e.g. design, writing, programming), or whatever else you want (e.g. bugs, sprint A, phase X).

Alors que les tâches sont généralement utilisées pour désigner le type d'activité (par exemple, la conception, le codage), le champ de description est le plus souvent utilisé pour la chose réelle sur laquelle vous avez travaillé (par exemple, "Corriger le bogue #638").

Modifier les étiquettes #
-------------------------

Par défaut, le temps dans Clockify peut être catégorisé par Client/Projet/Tâche.

Pour changer ces étiquettes en quelque chose d'autre :

1. Allez dans les paramètres
2. Trouvez **Organiser le temps par**
3. Choisissez ce que vous souhaitez renommer

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/custom-hierarchy.png)

Gérer des clients #
-------------------

Par défaut, **les propriétaires** et **les administrateurs** peuvent créer des clients. Toutefois, cet ensemble d'autorisations peut être modifié si l'option **Qui peut créer des projets et des clients** est définie sur **Administrateurs et gestionnaires** ou **Tout le monde** dans les **Paramètres de l'espace de travail**.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image_1-2.png)

* **Admins** (par défaut) : administrateurs
* **Admins et chefs de projet** : administrateurs et chef


## Chunk 4

* **Admins** (par défaut) : administrateurs
* **Admins et chefs de projet** : administrateurs et chef de projet
* **Tout le monde** : administrateurs, chefs de projet, chefs d'équipe, utilisateurs réguliers

Les utilisateurs réguliers pourront créer des clients lorsqu'ils créeront un nouveau projet. Cependant, ils ne pourront toujours pas voir la page **Clients**.

### Comment les propriétaires, les admins et les chefs de projet peuvent créer des clients #

Si vous êtes le propriétaire ou un administrateur de l'espace de travail, pour créer un client, il vous suffit de :

# [ARTICLE] Catégoriser le temps avec les champs obligatoires et les balises
https://clockify.me/help/fr/getting-started/categorize-time-using-required-fields-tags/

# Catégoriser le temps avec les champs obligatoires et les balises


## Chunk 1

Champs obligatoires #
---------------------

Les **champs obligatoires** sont les champs minimums qui doivent être remplis avant de pouvoir créer une saisie de temps.
Utilisez les champs obligatoires pour éviter les saisies de temps incomplètes, afin que toutes les saisies contiennent les données essentielles telles que le projet, la tâche, la balise et la description, et pour améliorer la précision et la cohérence de vos rapports.

Les champs obligatoires peuvent être créés sur les espaces de travail de tous les abonnements payants.

Pour utiliser les champs obligatoires en tant que chef d’équipe ou chef de projet, vous devez demander à votre administrateur d’activer cette fonctionnalité dans les paramètres de l’espace de travail.

### Comment fonctionnent les champs obligatoires #

Une fois les champs obligatoires activés, certains champs doivent être remplis avant que les saisies de temps puissent être enregistrées ou suivies.

Par exemple :

*Si le projet et la balise sont marqués comme obligatoires, les utilisateurs ne peuvent pas soumettre une saisie de temps sans sélectionner un projet et une balise. De plus, le minuteur ne peut pas être arrêté tant qu’un projet et un balise n’ont pas été attribués. Même si le champ tâche est facultatif, les champs projet et balise seront obligatoires. Si une tâche est obligatoire, seuls les projets comportant des tâches apparaîtront dan


## Chunk 2

st facultatif, les champs projet et balise seront obligatoires. Si une tâche est obligatoire, seuls les projets comportant des tâches apparaîtront dans le sélecteur de projet. Si aucun projet ne comporte de tâches, ce projet ne pourra pas être sélectionné pour le suivi du temps.*

**Important à noter**:

* Seuls les **Administrateurs** peuvent configurer et modifier les champs obligatoires dans les **Paramètres de l’espace de travail**
* Si un champ obligatoire est manquant, le système invitera l’utilisateur à compléter les informations manquantes avant de finaliser la saisie de temps

Les **balises** sont un outil puissant pour classer les saisies de temps. En associant des balises aux saisies de temps, vous pouvez facilement filtrer et générer des rapports sur différents types de travail.
Utilisez les balises pour regrouper les saisies de temps par tâches spécifiques, clients, types de projets ou tout autre critère pertinent pour votre flux de travail. Les balises facilitent la génération de rapports détaillés et l’analyse de la répartition du temps entre les projets ou les équipes.

Les balises sont **obligatoires** quand les champs obligatoires sont activés, ce qui garantit que toutes les saisies de temps sont classées de manière appropriée. Vous pouvez utiliser les balises existantes ou en créer de nouvelles lors de la saisie du temps.

1. Accédez à la page **Balises** dep

ère appropriée. Vous pouvez utiliser les balises existantes ou en créer de nouvelles lors de la saisie du temps.

1. Accédez à la page **Balises** depuis la barre latérale
2. Saisissez le nom de la balise et cliquez sur **Ajouter**

Ou :

1. Cliquez sur l’icône **Balise** sur une saisie de temps
2. Commencez à taper le nom de la balise
3. Click Create tag or press Ctrl/^(Control)+Enter

Toutes les balises supprimées seront supprimées des saisies de temps auxquelles elles sont associées.

* Vous pouvez configurer des **balises personnalisées** en fonction des besoins de votre projet
* Les balises peuvent être **attribuées à des projets, des tâches et des saisies de temps**, ce qui vous offre une grande flexibilité dans le suivi et la création de rapports sur le temps

* Assurez-vous que tous les membres de l’équipe utilisent des balises cohérentes pour faciliter la création de rapports et l’analyse
* Créez un système de balises (p. ex. Client A > Recherche > Développement) pour organiser les saisies
* Vérifiez régulièrement quels champs doivent être marqués comme obligatoires afin de les adapter aux besoins évolutifs de votre équipe

## Chunk 4

individuels ? #

Non, les champs obligatoires sont définis **au niveau de l’espace de travail** et s’appliquent à **toutes les saisies de temps** de cet espace. Cela signifie que vous ne pouvez pas désigner différents champs obligatoires pour des projets ou des tâches individuels. Par exemple, si vous marquez les champs **Projet** et **Balise** comme obligatoires, alors chaque utilisateur, pour tous les projets de l’espace de travail, devra fournir un projet et une balise lors de la saisie de son temps, quel que soit le projet ou la tâche spécifique. Cependant, vous pouvez personnaliser les champs obligatoires pour votre espace de travail en choisissant quels champs (p. ex. **Projet**, **Tâche**, **Balise** ou **Description**) sont obligatoires pour la saisie de temps.

#### Est-il possible de désactiver les champs obligatoires après les avoir activés ? #

Oui, vous pouvez modifier les champs obligatoires à tout moment, mais seuls les **administrateurs** ont l’autorisation de le faire. Si vous décidez que certains champs n’ont plus besoin d’être obligatoires (p. ex. vous ne voulez plus que le champ **Description** soit requis), vous pouvez aller dans les **Paramètres de l’espace de travail** et désactiver ce champ. Cependant, gardez à l’esprit que toute modification apportée aux champs obligatoires s’appliquera **à toutes les futures saisies de temps**, et que les saisies de t


## Chunk 5

dez à l’esprit que toute modification apportée aux champs obligatoires s’appliquera **à toutes les futures saisies de temps**, et que les saisies de temps déjà soumises (même avec des informations manquantes) resteront telles quelles.

Absolument ! Les balises sont un outil puissant pour **catégoriser** et **filtrer** vos saisies de temps. En utilisant les balises de manière cohérente dans votre espace de travail, vous pouvez facilement générer des rapports basés sur les balises que vous avez assignées. Par exemple, si vous utilisez des balises pour différentes phases de projet (par ex. Planification, Développement et Test), vous pouvez filtrer vos saisies de temps pour voir combien de temps a été consacré à chaque phase. De même, les balises peuvent être utilisées pour différencier les clients, les types de travail (p. ex. Facturable, Interne) ou d’autres catégories pertinentes.

#### Les champs obligatoires peuvent-ils être appliqués aux saisies de temps effectuées via l’appli mobile ou l’extension de navigateur ? #

Oui, les paramètres des **champs obligatoires** s’appliquent aux saisies de temps effectuées sur toutes les plateformes, y compris **l’appli mobile** et **l’extension de navigateur**. Si vous essayez de saisir du temps via un appareil et que les champs obligatoires (comme **Projet** ou **Balise**) ne sont pas remplis, vous serez invité à compléter les information


## Chunk 6

mps via un appareil et que les champs obligatoires (comme **Projet** ou **Balise**) ne sont pas remplis, vous serez invité à compléter les informations manquantes avant de pouvoir enregistrer la saisie.

#### Quel est l’impact des champs obligatoires sur les saisies de temps existantes ? #

Les champs obligatoires n’affectent que les saisies de temps nouvelles ou mises à jour après leur activation. Si les champs obligatoires sont configurés au milieu d’un projet, les saisies de temps déjà effectuées ne seront pas rétroactivement soumises à ces champs. Cependant, à partir du moment où les champs obligatoires sont activés, toute **nouvelle saisie de temps** ou toute **mise à jour de saisies existantes** devra respecter les nouvelles exigences. Cela garantit qu’à l’avenir, toutes les données saisies seront complètes et organisées.

# Categorização de tempo e etiquetas no Clockify


## Chunk 1

Clockify permite categorizar e analisar o tempo usando uma hierarquia de quatro níveis: descrição, tarefas, projetos e clientes.

Para categorização adicional, você também pode usar etiquetas, que funcionam independentemente da hierarquia.

Se deseja categorizar o tempo de forma diferente, pode renomear os rótulos de Projeto, Cliente e Tarefa como desejar.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/organization-schema-in-clockify.png)

Como você pode organizar entradas de tempo #
--------------------------------------------

* **Se você trabalha para clientes**, nomeie os projetos com o título da tarefa que o cliente fez (ex.: “Análise de comércio eletrônico”, “Redesenho do site”, “SuperApp”). Você também pode ter um projeto especial onde colocará todas as entradas de tempo não faturáveis ​​(ex.: e-mails, folgas, reuniões).
* **Se você trabalha para clientes**, mas deseja mantê-lo simples, basta usar o nome do cliente como o nome do projeto e, em seguida, usar tarefas para indicar que tipo de serviço você forneceu (você também pode alterar o termo projeto para dizer cliente ).

* **Se você não trabalha com clientes**, pode usar projetos como áreas gerais de trabalho (ex.: prestação de serviços, operações, suporte).
* **Se você usar o Clockify para rastrear a produtividade pessoal,** poderá nomear os projetos por atividade (ex.: e-mails, trabalhando, estudando, cozinhando).

Clientes, projetos e tarefas #
------------------------------

Projetos são a principal forma de organizar seu tempo no Clockify. Em um nível superior, você pode agrupar projetos em torno de clientes (ou departamentos ou qualquer outra coisa). Saiba mais sobre como gerenciar projetos.

Clientes são usados para organizar projetos. Um cliente pode ter muitos projetos, mas um projeto só pode pertencer a um cliente.

Não é possível adicionar apenas um cliente a uma entrada de tempo, pois os clientes são usados como um mecanismo de agrupamento para projetos. No entanto, você pode criar um projeto com o nome de um cliente. Como alternativa, você pode criar uma etiqueta para cada cliente e adicioná-la a uma entrada de tempo, para depois organizar as entradas por etiqueta.

Se precisar de mais controle, você pode classificar ainda mais as entradas de tempo usando tarefas (por exemplo, subprojetos ou trabalhos) e usá-las para designar o tipo de trabalho (por exemplo, design, escrita, programação) o


## Chunk 3

tempo usando tarefas (por exemplo, subprojetos ou trabalhos) e usá-las para designar o tipo de trabalho (por exemplo, design, escrita, programação) ou qualquer outra coisa que você queira (por exemplo, bugs, sprint A, fase X).

Enquanto as tarefas são usadas para designar o tipo de atividade (ex.:, design, codificação), o campo de descrição é usado principalmente para especificar o que você realmente está fazendo (ex.: “Corrigir bug #638).

Alterando rótulos #
-------------------

Por padrão, o tempo no Clockify pode ser categorizado por Cliente/Projeto/Tarefa.

Para alterar esses rótulos para outro nome:

1. Vá para as Configurações
2. Busque **Organizar o tempo por**
3. Selecione o que você deseja renomear

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/custom-hierarchy.png)

Gerenciando clientes #
----------------------

Por padrão **proprietários** e **administradores** podem criar clientes. No entanto, esse conjunto de permissões pode ser modificado se **Quem pode criar projetos e clientes** estiver definido como **Administradores e gerentes** ou **Todos** nas **configurações do espaço de trabalho**.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image_1-2.png)

Quem pode criar clientes, se selecionado:

* **Administradores (padrão)**: administrador
* **Administradores e gerentes de projeto**: administradores e gerente de projeto
* **Todos**: administra


## Chunk 4

**Administradores (padrão)**: administrador
* **Administradores e gerentes de projeto**: administradores e gerente de projeto
* **Todos**: administradores, gerentes de projeto, gerentes de equipe, usuários regulares

Usuários regulares poderão criar clientes quando criarem um novo projeto. No entanto, eles ainda não poderão ver a página **Clientes**.

### Como proprietários, administradores e gerentes de projeto podem criar clientes #

Como criar um cliente se você for o proprietário ou administrador do espaço de trabalho:

1. Vá para a página **Clientes** na barra lateral
2. Digitar o nome do cliente no campo **Adicionar novo cliente**
3. Clique em **Adicionar**

### Como os usuários regulares podem criar clientes #

Se você deseja que **usuários regulares** adicione clientes:

1. O administrador ou proprietário precisa definir **Quem pode criar projetos e clientes**  como **Todos**
2. Um usuário comum pode acessar a página Projetos para criar um projeto
3. Clicar em **Selecionar cliente**
4. Digite o nome do cliente
5. Clique em **Criar cliente** ou pressione **Ctrl /^ (Control) + Enter**

Se você deseja criar apenas um cliente, siga as etapas mencionadas acima e cancele a criação do projeto.

### Arquivar clientes #

Somente proprietários e administradores do espaço de trabalho podem arquivar clientes. Depois que o cliente for arquivado, você poderá excluí-lo.

## Chunk 6

quiser limpar sua página **Clientes**, poderá excluí-los em massa da seguinte maneira:

1. Marque a caixa **Nome** na página **Clientes**
2. Clique em **Excluir**
3. Digite DELETE nas janelas pop-up
4. Clique em **Excluir** para confirmar a ação

Todos os clientes excluídos serão removidos das entradas de horário às quais estão atribuídos.

Quando projetos e tarefas não são suficientes para manter a organização, use as etiquetas.

As etiquetas estão disponíveis em todo o espaço de trabalho. Elas funcionam independentemente do projeto, então você pode criar uma etiqueta, usá-la em vários projetos e filtrar relatórios com base nelas. Você pode até usar várias etiquetas para filtrar relatórios com mais precisão.

Elas também podem ser usadas para colocar informações adicionais nas entradas de tempo. Por exemplo, você pode:

* Mark time entries with **non-standard billing rates or currencies** so you know how to invoice them
* Marque **entradas de tempo que você faturou** com a tag **faturado** para não cobrar um cliente duas vezes (você pode usar edição em massa para atualizar várias entradas de uma vez)
* Mark what **type of work or service you provide** (e.g. project management, feedback, debugging, coding), so you can see how much time takes to perform a specific type of work across all projects
* Mark what **part of business** you’re working on (e.g. internal, support, client


## Chunk 7

time takes to perform a specific type of work across all projects
* Mark what **part of business** you’re working on (e.g. internal, support, client work, mobile)
* Marcar a quantidade de **horas extras** que você trabalhou

As etiquetas são úteis porque você pode usá-las como palavras-chave pelas quais você pode filtrar relatórios para encontrar exatamente o que você precisa.

Antes de usar tags, você precisa criá-las digitando um novo nome de tag no seletor de tags e pressionando **Ctrl / ^ (Control) + Enter**. Depois de criar uma tag, todos os usuários no seu espaço de trabalho podem selecioná-la ao controlar o tempo.

Todos podem criar etiquetas (embora você possa limitar a criação aos administradores apenas nas configurações do espaço de trabalho). Somente administradores podem editar e excluir elas. Você pode criar quantas etiquetas quiser.

1. Vá para a página Etiquetas na barra lateral
2. Digite o nome da etiqueta e clique em ADICIONAR

Ou:

1. Clique no ícone de etiqueta em uma entrada de tempo
2. Comece a digitar o nome da etiqueta

4. Clique em **Excluir** para confirmar a ação

Todas as etiquetas excluídas serão removidas das entradas de tempo às quais estão atribuídas.

Você pode filtrar entradas de horas em relatórios de três maneiras:

* **Contém** – todas as entradas que contêm essa etiqueta serão exibidas (por exemplo, se uma entrada tiver A e B e você filtrar **Contém: A**, essa entrada será exibida)
* **Não contém**  – apenas as entradas que não possuem essa etiqueta serão mostradas (por exemplo, se uma entrada tiver as etiquetas A e B e você filtrar **Não contém: A**, essa entrada não será exibida)
  )

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-20-at-14.00.41.png)

* Se você alterar o nome da etiqueta na seção Etiquetas, as entradas de tempo que tiverem essa etiqueta aplicada permanecerão marcadas com a etiqueta renomeada
* Se você usar a edição em massa para alterar etiquetas nas entradas de tempo, terá a opção de adicionar uma nova ou substituir a existente
* Se você excluir uma etiqueta, todas as entradas de tempo com essa etiqueta aplicada ficarão sem etiqueta

Organização avançada #
----------------------

O Clockify permite que você categorize o tempo ainda mais com campos personalizados.

O campo personalizado é um uma ferramenta paga, que você pode ativar atualizando
 para o plano PRO.

Os campos personalizados permitem que seus usuários coloquem informações adicionais nas entradas de tempo (por exemplo, despesas, quilometragem, etc.), além de poder categorizar automaticamente as entradas de tempo com base em um projeto.

Por exemplo, se tiver projetos que foram realizados em locais diferentes, você poderá criar um campo personalizado chamado local e infor

um projeto.

Por exemplo, se tiver projetos que foram realizados em locais diferentes, você poderá criar um campo personalizado chamado local e informar qual projeto pertence a qual local. Então, ao baixar um relatório, você poderá criar um relatório personalizado, e agrupar e classificar o tempo por local.

# Categorize o tempo usando campos e etiquetas obrigatórios Clockify


## Chunk 1

Campos obrigatórios #
---------------------

**Campos obrigatórios** são os campos mínimos que devem ser preenchidos antes que uma entrada de tempo possa ser criada.
Use campos obrigatórios para evitar entradas de tempo incompletas, para que todas as entradas tenham dados essenciais como projeto, tarefa, etiqueta e descrição, e melhore a precisão e a consistência dos seus relatórios.

Campos obrigatórios podem ser criados em espaços de trabalho que estão em todos os planos pagos.

Para usar os amigos necessários como gerente de equipe ou gerente de projeto, você precisará que seu administrador habilite esse recurso nas configurações do espaço de trabalho.

### Como funcionam os campos obrigatórios #

Depois que os campos obrigatórios forem habilitados, certos campos deverão ser preenchidos antes que as entradas de tempo possam ser salvas ou rastreadas.

Por exemplo:

*Se o* ***projeto*** *e a* ***etiqueta*** *forem marcados como obrigatórios, os usuários não poderão enviar uma entrada de tempo sem selecionar um projeto e uma tag. Além disso, o cronômetro não poderá ser interrompido até que um projeto e uma etiqueta sejam atribuídos. Mesmo que o campo de tarefa seja opcional, os campos de projeto e etiqueta serão obrigatórios.*
*Se uma tarefa for obrigatória, somente os projetos com tarefas aparecerão no seletor de projetos. Se não houver tarefas para um projeto, esse projeto nã


## Chunk 2

uma tarefa for obrigatória, somente os projetos com tarefas aparecerão no seletor de projetos. Se não houver tarefas para um projeto, esse projeto não poderá ser selecionado para o controle de tempo.*

**Importante observação**:

* Somente **administradores** podem configurar e alterar campos obrigatórios nas **Configurações do espaço de trabalho**
* Se um campo obrigatório estiver faltando, o sistema solicitará que o usuário preencha as informações ausentes antes que a entrada de tempo seja finalizada.

**Etiquetas** é uma funcionalidade poderosa para categorizar entradas de tempo. Ao associar etiquetas a entradas de tempo, você pode filtrar e gerar relatórios facilmente sobre vários tipos de trabalho.
Use etiquetas para agrupar entradas de tempo por tarefas, clientes, tipos de projeto específicos ou qualquer outro critério relevante para o seu fluxo de trabalho. As etiquetas facilitam a geração de relatórios detalhados e a análise de onde o tempo está sendo gasto em cada projeto ou equipe.

As etiquetas são **obrigatórias** quando os campos obrigatórios estão habilitados, garantindo que todas as entradas de tempo sejam categorizadas corretamente. Você pode usar etiquetas existentes ou criar novas ao inserir o tempo.

2. Comece a digitar o nome da etiqueta
3. Clique em Criar etiqueta ou pressione Ctrl/^(Control)+Enter

Todas as etiquetas excluídas serão removidas das entradas de tempo às quais estão atribuídas.

* Você pode configurar **etiquetas personalizadas** com base nas necessidades do seu projeto
* As etiquetas podem ser **atribuídas a projetos, tarefas e entradas de tempo**, proporcionando flexibilidade na maneira como você rastreia e relata o tempo.

* Certifique-se de que todos os membros da equipe usem etiquetas consistentes para facilitar a geração de relatórios e análises
* Crie um sistema de etiquetas (por exemplo, Cliente A > Pesquisa > Desenvolvimento) para manter as entradas organizadas
* Revise regularmente quais campos devem ser marcados como obrigatórios para ajustá-los às necessidades em evolução da sua equipe

Perguntas frequentes #
----------------------

#### Posso definir campos obrigatórios para projetos ou tarefas individuais? #

Não, os campos obrigatórios são definidos no nível do espaço de trabalho e se aplicam a todas as entradas de tempo no espaço de trabalho. Isso significa que você não pode designar campos obrigatórios diferentes para projetos ou tarefas individuais. Por exemplo, se você marcar os campos Projeto


## Chunk 4

ignifica que você não pode designar campos obrigatórios diferentes para projetos ou tarefas individuais. Por exemplo, se você marcar os campos Projeto e Marcador como obrigatórios, todos os usuários de todos os projetos no espaço de trabalho precisarão fornecer um projeto e uma marca ao registrar o tempo, independentemente do projeto ou tarefa específica. No entanto, você pode personalizar os campos obrigatórios para o seu espaço de trabalho como um todo, escolhendo quais campos (por exemplo, Projeto, Tarefa, Marcador ou Descrição) são obrigatórios para entradas de tempo.

#### Posso desabilitar campos obrigatórios depois de habilitá-los? #

Sim, você pode modificar os campos obrigatórios a qualquer momento, mas apenas **administradores** têm permissão para isso. Se você decidir que determinados campos não precisam mais ser obrigatórios (por exemplo, se não quiser mais que o campo **Descrição** seja obrigatório), você pode acessar as **Configurações do Workspace** e desativar esse campo. No entanto, lembre-se de que quaisquer alterações feitas nos campos obrigatórios serão aplicadas a **todos os registros de tempo futuros**, e quaisquer registros de tempo já enviados (mesmo com informações ausentes) permanecerão como estão.

Com certeza! As etiquetas são uma ferramenta poderosa para **categorizar** e **filtrar** suas entradas de tempo. Ao usar etiquetas consistentemente em todo


## Chunk 5

erteza! As etiquetas são uma ferramenta poderosa para **categorizar** e **filtrar** suas entradas de tempo. Ao usar etiquetas consistentemente em todo o seu espaço de trabalho, você pode facilmente gerar relatórios com base nas etiquetas atribuídas. Por exemplo, se você usar etiquetas para diferentes fases do projeto (por exemplo, Planejamento, Desenvolvimento e Testes), poderá filtrar suas entradas de tempo para ver quanto tempo foi gasto em cada fase. Da mesma forma, as etiquetas podem ser usadas para diferenciar entre clientes, tipos de trabalho (por exemplo, Faturável, Interno) ou outras categorias relevantes.

#### Campos obrigatórios podem ser aplicados a entradas de tempo registradas por meio do aplicativo móvel ou da extensão do navegador? #

Sim, as configurações dos **campos obrigatórios** se aplicam aos registros de tempo feitos em todas as plataformas, incluindo o **aplicativo móvel** e a **extensão do navegador**. Se você tentar registrar o tempo em qualquer dispositivo e os campos obrigatórios (como **Projeto** ou **Etiqueta**) não estiverem preenchidos, você será solicitado a preencher as informações ausentes antes de salvar o registro.

#### Como os campos obrigatórios afetam as entradas de tempo existentes? #

Os campos obrigatórios só afetam entradas de tempo novas ou atualizadas após serem habilitados. Se os campos obrigatórios forem configurados no meio de u


## Chunk 6

campos obrigatórios só afetam entradas de tempo novas ou atualizadas após serem habilitados. Se os campos obrigatórios forem configurados no meio de um projeto, as entradas de tempo já registradas não os exigirão retroativamente. No entanto, a partir do momento em que os campos obrigatórios forem ativados, quaisquer **novas entradas de tempo** ou **atualizações de entradas existentes** precisarão atender aos novos requisitos. Isso garante que, daqui para frente, todos os dados registrados estejam completos e organizados.

#### Posso personalizar quais usuários são afetados pelos campos obrigatórios? #

Não, os campos obrigatórios se aplicam a todos os usuários no espaço de trabalho uma vez habilitados, independentemente de sua função (por exemplo, administrador, gerente de projeto, membro da equipe).
Para obter assistência adicional ou para configurar campos e etiquetas obrigatórios de acordo com as necessidades específicas do seu espaço de trabalho, você sempre pode entrar em contato com o **administrador do seu espaço de trabalho** ou consultar nossa **Central de Ajuda** para obter instruções detalhadas e práticas recomendadas.

# Categorize time using required fields & tags - Clockify Help


## Chunk 1

Required fields #
-----------------

**Required fields** are the minimum fields that must be completed before a time entry can be created.
Use required fields to prevent incomplete time entries, so that all entries have essential data like project, task, tag, and description and improve the accuracy and consistency of your reports.

Required fields can be created on workspaces that are on all paid plans.

To use required fiends as a Team manager or Project manager, you’ll need your Admin to enable this feature in the Workspace settings.

### How required fields work #

Once required fields are enabled, certain fields must be filled out before time entries can be saved or tracked.

For example:

*If* ***project*** *and* ***tag*** *are marked as required, users cannot submit a time entry without selecting a project and tag. Also, the timer cannot be stopped until a project and tag are assigned. Even if the task field is optional, the project and tag fields will be mandatory.*
*If a task is required, only projects with tasks will appear in the project picker. If no tasks exist for a project, that project will not be selectable for time tracking.*

**Important to note**:

* Only **admins** can set up and change required fields in the **Workspace settings**
* If a required field is missing, the system will prompt the user to complete the missing information before the time entry is


## Chunk 2

**Workspace settings**
* If a required field is missing, the system will prompt the user to complete the missing information before the time entry is finalized

**Tags** are a powerful tool for categorizing time entries. By associating tags with time entries, you can easily filter and report on various types of work.
Use tags to group time entries by specific tasks, clients, project types, or any other criteria relevant to your workflow. Tags make it easier to generate detailed reports and analyze where time is being spent across projects or teams.

Tags are **mandatory** when required fields are enabled, ensuring all time entries are categorized appropriately. You can use existing tags, or create new ones when entering time.

1. Go to Tags page from sidebar
2. Type tag name and click ADD

Or:

1. Click tag icon on a time entry
2. Start typing tag name
3. Click Create tag or press Ctrl/^(Control)+Enter

All deleted tags will be removed from time entries they are assigned to.

* You can set up **custom tags** based on your project needs
* Tags can be **assigned to projects, tasks, and time entries**, providing flexibility in how you track and report time.

* Makesure all team members use consistent tags for easy reporting and analysis

FAQ #
-----

#### Can I set required fields for individual projects or tasks? #

No, required fields are set at the **workspace level** and apply to **all time entries** across the workspace. This means you cannot designate different required fields for individual projects or tasks. For instance, if you mark the **Project** and **Tag** fields as required, then every user across all projects in the workspace will need to provide a project and a tag when logging time, regardless of the specific project or task. However, you can customize the required fields for your workspace as a whole by choosing which field (e.g. **Project**, **Task**, **Tag**, or **Description)** are mandatory for time entries.

#### Can I disable required fields after enabling them? #

Yes, you can modify the required fields at any time, but only **admins** have the permissions to do so. If you decide that certain fields no longer need to be mandatory (e.g. you no longer want the **Description** field to be required), you can go into the **Workspace settings** and disable that field. However, keep in mind that any changes made to the required fields will apply to **all future time entries**, and any time entries t


## Chunk 4

sable that field. However, keep in mind that any changes made to the required fields will apply to **all future time entries**, and any time entries that were already submitted (even with missing information) will remain as they are.

Absolutely! Tags are a powerful tool for **categorizing** and **filtering** your time entries. By using tags consistently across your workspace, you can easily generate reports based on the tags you’ve assigned. For example, if you use tags for different project phases (e.g. Planning, Development, and Testing), you can filter your time entries to see how much time was spent in each phase. Similarly, tags can be used to differentiate between clients, types of work (e.g. Billable, Internal), or other relevant categories.

#### Can required fields be applied to time entries logged via the mobile app or browser extension? #

Yes, the **required fields** settings apply to time entries made across all platforms, including the **mobile app** and **browser extension**. If you attempt to log time via any device and the required fields (like **Project** or **Tag**) are not completed, you will be prompted to fill in the missing information before you can save the entry.

#### How do required fields impact existing time entries? #

Required fields only affect new or updated time entries after they are enabled. If the required fields are set up in the middle o


## Chunk 5

ing time entries? #

Required fields only affect new or updated time entries after they are enabled. If the required fields are set up in the middle of a project, time entries that have already been logged will not retroactively require the fields. However, from the moment the required fields are activated, any **new time entries** or **updates to existing entries** will need to meet the new requirements. This ensures that moving forward, all data logged is complete and organized.

#### Can I customize which users are affected by required fields? #

No, required fields apply to all users in the workspace once enabled, regardless of their role (e.g. Admin, Project Manager, Team Member).
For additional assistance or to configure required fields and tags according to your workspace’s specific needs, you can always reach out to your **Workspace admin** or consult our **Help Center** for detailed instructions and best practices.

## Chunk 1

Les champs d'utilisateur vous permettent d'ajouter des informations supplémentaires sur les membres de l'équipe (comme le titre du poste, la date de début, le poste, le téléphone, le département, l'ID de l'employé), et de les exporter plus tard avec les saisies de temps.

Il s'agit d'une fonctionnalité payante, disponible pour les utilisateurs des plans **Pro** et **Enterprise**.

Créer des champs d'utilisateurs #
---------------------------------

Pour créer un champ d'utilisateur, allez dans l'onglet **Paramètres de l'espace de travail** > **Champs personnalisés**, faites défiler la liste jusqu'à la section **Champs personnalisés d'utilisateur**, puis cliquez sur **Créer**.

Tout d'abord, vous devez spécifier le type de champ selon le type d'informations que vous souhaitez ajouter sur l'utilisateur.

* **Texte** – champ de saisie pour tout type d'information (p. ex. ID de l'employé, Emplacement, Date de début)
* **Nombre** – champ de saisie pour les valeurs numériques (p. ex. l'ID interne)
* **Lien**– champ de saisie qui accepte l'URL de sites Web ou de fichiers (p. ex. Certificat, Lien de profil)
* **Interrupteur** – un simple champ oui/non (p. ex. Temps partiel)
* **Sélectionner** – champ de saisie qui permet aux utilisateurs de sélectionner une seule option dans une liste prédéterminée (p. ex. Département)
* **Sélectionner plusieurs** – champ de saisie qui permet aux utili

* **Sélectionner plusieurs** – champ de saisie qui permet aux utilisateurs de sélectionner plusieurs valeurs à partir d'une liste prédéterminée (p. ex. Éligibilité)

Remplissez le nom, la description, le paramètre fictif et sélectionnez les valeurs (le cas échéant).

Une fois que vous avez créé un champ, faites-le glisser vers la colonne “Active” pour qu'il devienne visible dans les profils des utilisateurs.

Le nombre maximum de champs d'utilisateur créés est 50 et le nombre maximum de champs d'utilisateur actifs est 10.

Une fois le champ utilisateur créé et activé, allez sur la page **Équipe** et cliquez sur les trois points à côté d'un utilisateur.

Lorsque vous faites défiler la page vers le bas, vous verrez le champ d’utilisateur que vous avez créé et vous pourrez définir la valeur pour cet utilisateur.

Les valeurs des champs utilisateur peuvent être saisies par les **propriétaires** et les  **administrateur**.

Si une valeur est définie pour le champ de l'utilisateur, une fois que ce champ est glissé et déposé dans la colonne **Champs actifs** , cette valeur est transmise à tous les utilisateurs de l'équipe (actifs, inactifs et invités).

Si, à un moment donné, la valeur par défaut du **Champ d'utilisateur actif** change, cette nouvelle valeur est appliquée uniquement aux nouveaux utilisateurs (la valeur par défaut des utilisateurs existants ne change pas).

Les champs d'utilisateur peuvent être déplacés par glisser-déposer entre les **champs disponibles** et les **champs actifs**.

La suppression d'un champ utilisateur supprime ce champ et toutes ses données de tous les membres, dans tout l'espace de travail. Une fois que vous avez supprimé un champ, c'est comme s'il n'avait jamais existé. Vous ne pouvez pas annuler cette action.

Pour conserver les données, il est préférable de désactiver un champ personnalisé en le déplaçant dans la **Colonne disponible**.

Champs d'utilisateur dans les rapports #

Les champs obligatoires sont une fonctionnalité payante, que vous pouvez activer en mettant à niveau votre espace de travail vers l'un des plans payants.

Comment activer les champs obligatoires #
-----------------------------------------

Sur la page des paramètres de l'espace de travail, les administrateurs peuvent définir quels champs d'une saisie des temps sont obligatoires avant que la saisie des temps puisse être créée.

Vous pouvez rendre obligatoire les champs suivants :

* Projet
* Tâche
* Balise
* Description

Lorsque la tâche est un champ obligatoire, les projets qui n'ont pas de tâches n'apparaissent pas dans le sélecteur de projets.

Comment cela fonctionne #
-------------------------

Par exemple, si vous cochez projet et balises comme requis :

* Personne ne peut ajouter une entrée de temps sans un projet et une balise (pas même les admins)
* Le minuteur peut être lancé mais ne peut pas être arrêté tant que vous n'avez pas ajouté un projet et une balise
* La feuille de temps ne vous permet pas d'ajouter du temps sans sélectionner un

# Champs personnalisés - Clockify centre d’aide


## Chunk 1

Ajoutez des champs supplémentaires aux saisies de temps et suivez tout ce que vous voulez !

Grâce aux champs personnalisés, vous pouvez suivre les pauses, les heures supplémentaires, le statut de la facture, le nombre d’unités, les listes déroulantes personnalisées, la quantité, les codes, l’emplacement, l’équipement, l’estimation, le numéro de transaction, le lien vers le ticket, les reçus, les images, toutes sortes d’identifiants (facture, tâche, utilisateur, projet)... et plus encore !

En plus des données des utilisateurs, vous pouvez également suivre les métadonnées des projets, ce qui est idéal pour analyser les données dans des tableaux croisés dynamiques ou pour intégrer Clockify à des systèmes externes par le biais d'une API.

Si vous souhaitez ajouter des champs personnalisés aux utilisateurs (comme l'ID de l'employé), vous pouvez utiliser des champs d'utilisateur.

Les champs personnalisés sont une fonctionnalité payante, que vous pouvez activer en en mettant à niveau votre espace de travail vers le plan Pro ou Enterprise.

Les utilisateurs peuvent saisir des données dans des champs personnalisés via le web, une extension de navigateur, iOS, Android, Mac et Windows.

Pour obtenir des conseils généraux sur les champs personnalisés, regardez la vidéo et suivez les instructions ci-dessous.

Créer des champs #
------------------

Vous pouvez créer des champs personnalisés dans les Paramètres de l'espace de travail > onglet Champs personnalisés. Vous pouvez avoir jusqu'à 50 champs dans un espace de travail.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/custom-field-interface.png)

Lorsque vous créez un champ, vous devez spécifier le type de champ :

* **Texte** – champ de saisie dans lequel vous pouvez taper ce que vous souhaitez (ID du projet, notes supplémentaires, coordonnées)
* **Nombre** – champ de saisie qui accepte uniquement des valeurs numériques (kilométrage, dépenses, nombre d'unités)
* **Lien**– champ de saisie qui accepte les URL de sites Web ou de fichiers (reçus, captures d'écran, documents, référence de la tâche)
* **Interrupteur** – un simple commutateur oui/non (facturé, payé, urgent)
* **Sélectionner** – champ de saisie qui permet aux utilisateurs de sélectionner une seule option dans une liste prédéterminée (emplacement, statut, catégorie)
* **Sélectionner plusieurs** – champ de saisie qui permet aux utilisateurs de sélectionner un nombre quelconque de valeurs dans une liste prédéterminée (équipement utilisé, liste de balises personnalisée pour un projet)


## Chunk 3

urs de sélectionner un nombre quelconque de valeurs dans une liste prédéterminée (équipement utilisé, liste de balises personnalisée pour un projet)

Vous pouvez également empêcher les utilisateurs ordinaires d'entrer ou de modifier des données en définissant l'option **Qui peut modifier : Admins** (p. ex. vous pouvez avoir un statut Impayé/Payé que les utilisateurs peuvent voir mais que seuls les administrateurs peuvent modifier).

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/custom-fiedl-new.png)

Utiliser les champs #
---------------------

Pour que vos utilisateurs puissent voir et utiliser les champs que vous avez créés, glissez-déposez le champ dans l'emplacement visible de la colonne active. Les champs apparaîtront alors dans le suivi du temps et la feuille de temps pour tous les utilisateurs de l'espace de travail.

Dans la feuille de temps, vous pouvez saisir des données pour des champs supplémentaires lorsque vous survolez une cellule avec l'heure et cliquez sur les trois points.

Vous pouvez avoir jusqu'à 5 champs visibles pour l'ensemble de l'espace de travail, plus 5 autres sur les projets.

Les champs fonctionnent comme des saisies normales, selon le type de champ que vous avez spécifié. Les utilisateurs peuvent saisir du texte, un nombre, cocher une case ou choisir dans une liste de valeurs prédéterminées.

**Quand utiliser les champs invisibles**

Les


## Chunk 4

euvent saisir du texte, un nombre, cocher une case ou choisir dans une liste de valeurs prédéterminées.

**Quand utiliser les champs invisibles**

Les champs invisibles sont utiles lorsque vous avez besoin d’intégrer Clockify avec des systèmes externes via une API, ou lorsque vous avez besoin que les saisies héritent de métadonnées supplémentaires des projets (comme l’ID du projet ou le type de projet) et que vous ne voulez pas surcharger vos utilisateurs avec des données non pertinentes.

Si vous activez un champ et le rendez invisible, les utilisateurs ne le verront nulle part, mais toutes les saisies créées en seront dotées. Les saisies peuvent hériter de la valeur des champs invisibles via le projet, ou vous pouvez les mettre à jour via l’API ou une autre intégration.

Les champs invisibles et leurs données apparaissent dans les exportations Excel et CSV du rapport détaillé.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/custom-field-usage.png)

Définir des champs sur les projets #
------------------------------------

Outre l'activation des champs personnalisés pour l'ensemble de l'espace de travail, vous pouvez également les activer par projet, ainsi que modifier la visibilité et la valeur par défaut dans les paramètres du projet.

Tous les champs invisibles s'affichent automatiquement dans les projets. Vous pouvez définir leur valeur par défaut pour ce projet,


## Chunk 5

ètres du projet.

Tous les champs invisibles s'affichent automatiquement dans les projets. Vous pouvez définir leur valeur par défaut pour ce projet, et les rendre visibles (ou invisibles) lorsqu'un utilisateur sélectionne ce projet.

Vous pouvez avoir jusqu'à 10 champs visibles dans un projet.

À part la gestion des champs actifs, vous pouvez également ajouter un champ à partir d’une liste de champs disponibles, afin que seules les saisies de ce projet particulier disposent de ce champ.

Si vous souhaitez que les champs aient une certaine valeur par défaut lorsqu'un utilisateur sélectionne un projet. Par exemple, si un utilisateur sélectionne ProjectX, le champ **Localisation** peut être défini sur les **États-Unis**, que l'utilisateur peut remplacer ultérieurement s'il ne s'agit pas des **États-Unis**.

Faites attention aux valeurs par défaut, car elles remplacent toujours les valeurs existantes
 *Par exemple, si une saisie des heures a **Ma valeur** et que vous modifiez ensuite un projet avec une **Valeur par défaut**, celle-ci remplacera **Ma valeur** (vous pouvez saisir à nouveau **Ma valeur**, mais si vous modifiez à nouveau le projet d'une saisie des heures, **Ma valeur** sera perdue).*

Un chef de projet peut modifier la visibilité d'un champ et définir une valeur par défaut pour ses projets.

## Chunk 6

isibilité d'un champ et définir une valeur par défaut pour ses projets.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/custom-field-project.png)

Utilisation avancée #
---------------------

Vous pouvez réaliser n'importe quel flux de travail dont vous avez besoin en utilisant ces quatre mécanismes :

* **Autorisation de modification** – Vous pouvez autoriser les utilisateurs à modifier les données d’un champ pour leurs saisies de temps, ou limiter la modification aux administrateurs uniquement.
* **Visibilité** – Affecte si les utilisateurs peuvent voir un champ dans le suivi du temps et la feuille de temps.
* **Valeur par défaut** – Les champs sur les saisies de temps sont vides au départ, sauf si vous les remplissez avec une valeur par défaut.
* **Remplacement des projets** – Vous pouvez remplacer la visibilité et la valeur par défaut d'un champ par projet.

Par exemple, vous pouvez définir un champ comme non modifiable par les utilisateurs standards et visible uniquement sur certains projets. Ou bien, vous pouvez rendre un champ invisible et définir une valeur par défaut pour les projets, de sorte que chaque saisie de temps possède ses métadonnées de projet.

## Chunk 7

| --- | --- | --- |
| Tout le monde | Visible | Vide | **Pour la saisie par l'utilisateur** Un utilisateur voit un champ de saisie et entre une valeur (p. ex. kilométrage, dépenses, reçus) |
| Tout le monde | Visible | Hérite | **Pour que les utilisateurs puissent passer outre si nécessaire** Un utilisateur voit un champ de saisie avec une valeur préremplie, qu'il peut modifier si nécessaire (p. ex. sélectionner une autre valeur) |
| Tout le monde | Invisible | Vide | **Pour les intégrations d'utilisateurs** Les saisies ont ce champ avec une valeur vide, qui ne peut être mise à jour que via l’API |
| Tout le monde | Invisible | Hérite | **Pour les métadonnées de projet** Toutes les saisies héritent des métadonnées d’un espace de travail ou d’un projet (p. ex. le nom de l’espace de travail, l’ID du projet) |
| Administrateurs | Visible | Vide | **Pour que les utilisateurs puissent suivre le statut** Les administrateurs modifient les saisies de temps des autres afin que les utilisateurs puissent voir plus tard le statut de leurs saisies (p. ex. l’administrateur indique que le temps a été payé) |
| Administrateurs | Visible | Hérite | **Pour la référence de l'utilisateur** Les saisies montrent aux utilisateurs des informations sur le projet à des fins de référence |

### Champ personnalisé obligatoire #

Vous pouvez également configurer un champ personnalisé de saisie de temps pour qu'il soit obligatoire pour chaque saisie de temps au niveau de l'espace de travail.
 Pour ce faire, un champ personnalisé de saisie de temps doit être défini comme **Visible** avec une valeur par défaut, ou édité par **Tout le monde**. S'il est configuré correctement, ce champ personnalisé apparaîtra dans les paramètres de l'espace de travail, sous la section **Ne pas autoriser l'enregistrement du temps sans**, dans l'onglet **Général**. Après avoir été sélectionné dans une case à cocher, le champ apparaîtra dans le suivi du temps et la feuille de temps comme un champ **obligatoire**.

Ainsi, la prochaine fois qu’un utilisateur voudra enregistrer une saisie de temps, il devra insérer les données dans ce champ obligatoire.

## Chunk 9

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-17-at-16.55.40-1024x86.png)

Modifier et supprimer des champs #
----------------------------------

L’activation d’un champ n’a pas d’impact sur les anciennes saisies. Seules les nouvelles saisies de temps à venir auront des champs personnalisés et des valeurs par défaut. Pour ajouter rétroactivement des champs aux saisies de temps, vous devrez mettre à jour manuellement les saisies de temps.

Si vous faites passer un champ d’Actif à Disponible, les nouvelles saisies ne comporteront plus ce champ, mais les saisies existantes conserveront leurs données et apparaîtront dans les exportations.

La suppression d’un champ personnalisé supprime ce champ et toutes ses données de toutes les saisies de temps, dans tout l’espace de travail. Une fois que vous avez supprimé un champ, c’est comme s’il n’avait jamais existé. Il n’y a pas d’annulation possible. Pour conserver les données, il est préférable de le désactiver en déplaçant le champ vers la colonne “Disponible”.

Si vous modifiez les options d'un champ de type **Sélectionner** , les saisies de temps existantes conserveront les valeurs originales. Sauf si :

* Vous modifiez manuellement la valeur du champ personnalisé de type **Sélectionner** sur la saisie de temps à un


## Chunk 10

t les valeurs originales. Sauf si :

* Vous modifiez manuellement la valeur du champ personnalisé de type **Sélectionner** sur la saisie de temps à une valeur différente.
* Vous changez le projet de la saisie de temps en un projet qui a une valeur par défaut définie pour ce champ de type **Sélectionner** . Dans ce cas, la saisie obtiendra la valeur par défaut pour le champ personnalisé de type **Sélectionner** du projet que vous avez sélectionné.

### Modifier un champ personnalisé – exemple #

Disons que vous avez un champ personnalisé de type **Sélectionner** nommé **Localisation** avec 3 options de sélection : **Los Angeles**, **New York**, et **Boston**.

Vous créez une saisie de temps et sélectionnez **Los Angeles** comme emplacement. Vous allez ensuite dans les paramètres de l'espace de travail et renommez l'option **Los Angeles** en **San Francisco**.

La saisie créée conservera la valeur **Los Angeles**.

Si vous modifiez la saisie créée et changez son projet en un projet dont le champ Localisation a une valeur par défaut (p. ex. New York), la saisie aura désormais **New York** comme emplacement. En d’autres termes, la valeur par défaut remplacera la valeur originale chaque fois que vous mettrez à jour une saisie.

Autre exemple : imaginons que vous créiez un champ intitulé **Mise à jour**, que vous lui attribuiez la valeur par défaut **2020**, et que vous le rendiez in


## Chunk 11

xemple : imaginons que vous créiez un champ intitulé **Mise à jour**, que vous lui attribuiez la valeur par défaut **2020**, et que vous le rendiez invisible. Vos anciennes saisies n'auront pas ce champ, mais chaque saisie ultérieure l'aura.

Si quelqu’un modifie le projet sur son ancienne saisie, cette saisie reprendra la valeur **2020** même si elle ne l’a jamais eue, ce qui vous permettra de voir si une saisie a été modifiée.

Champs personnalisés dans les rapports #
----------------------------------------

Vous pouvez récupérer les saisies de temps avec tous leurs champs et données dans le rapport détaillé via l’exportation Excel et CSV. Vous pouvez ensuite créer toutes sortes de rapports personnalisés dans des tableaux croisés dynamiques.

Vous pouvez voir et modifier les données des champs visibles directement dans le rapport détaillé. En outre, les administrateurs peuvent modifier les données des champs personnalisés que d’autres utilisateurs ont saisies (les membres standards ne peuvent modifier et supprimer que les saisies de temps qui leur appartiennent).

Vous pouvez également utiliser la modification en bloc pour mettre à jour les champs personnalisés de plusieurs saisies de temps en un seul clic.

Les exportations Excel et CSV répertorient tous les champs actifs. Si une saisie possède une valeur dans un champ personnalisé qui n’est plus actif ni dans l’espace de t


## Chunk 12

cel et CSV répertorient tous les champs actifs. Si une saisie possède une valeur dans un champ personnalisé qui n’est plus actif ni dans l’espace de travail ni dans un projet, ce champ n’apparaîtra pas.

Télécharger un exemple de rapport (Excel)

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/detailed-report-pivot-custom-fields-3.png)

Les rapports vous permettent également de filtrer le rapport par des champs personnalisés. Vous pouvez facilement activer ou désactiver les champs personnalisés que vous souhaitez voir apparaître comme filtres et les utiliser pour filtrer les entrées de temps.

Ces filtres sont spécifiques à l'utilisateur. Lorsque vous ajoutez certains champs personnalisés aux filtres, cela n'affecte pas les autres utilisateurs. Chaque utilisateur peut disposer de son propre ensemble de filtres.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/custom-fields-wr-1024x433.png)

Importer des champs personnalisés #
-----------------------------------

Vous pouvez importer tous les champs personnalisés obligatoires **actifs**, **visibles** et **invisibles** à partir d’un fichier CSV. De cette façon, les rapports peuvent refléter tout le temps suivi spécifique à votre cas d’usage.

Les champs personnalisés ne peuvent être importés que lorsqu’ils font partie d’un fichier CSV contenant des saisies de temps.

Pour importer votre fichier CSV :

1. Naviguez

# [ARTICLE] Clasificación de tiempo y etiquetas en Clockify
https://clockify.me/help/es/track-time-and-expenses/categorizing-time-entries/

# Clasificación de tiempo y etiquetas en Clockify


## Chunk 1

Clockify te permite clasificar y analizar el tiempo usando una jerarquía de cuatro niveles: descripción, tareas, proyectos y clientes.

Para más clasificación, también puedes usar etiquetas, que funcionan independientemente de la jerarquía.

Si quieres clasificar el tiempo diferentemente, puedes renombrar los términos de Proyecto, Cliente y Tarea.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/organization-schema-in-clockify.png)

Cómo organizar las entradas de tiempo #
---------------------------------------

* **Si haces trabajo para clientes**, nombra los proyectos con el título de la asignación que ha hecho el cliente (por ejemplo, “Análisis de comercio electrónico”, “Rediseño del Sitio Web”, “SuperApp”). También puedes tener un proyecto especial donde pondrás todas las entradas de tiempo no facturables (por ejemplo, correos electrónicos, tiempo libre, reuniones).
* **Si haces trabajo para clientes pero quieres mantenerlo sencillo**, simplemente usa el nombre del cliente como el nombre del proyecto y entonces usa las tareas para indicar qué tipo de servicio has proporcionado (también puedes cambiar el término **proyecto** para que diga **cliente** en su lugar).
* **Si tienes proyectos comunes para clientes diferentes**, puedes usar proyectos para el tipo de servicio (por ejemplo, marketing, desarrollo) y usar las etiquetas para indicar con qué cliente se relaciona


## Chunk 2

**, puedes usar proyectos para el tipo de servicio (por ejemplo, marketing, desarrollo) y usar las etiquetas para indicar con qué cliente se relaciona una entrada de tiempo concreta.
* **Si no trabajas con clientes**, puedes usar proyectos como áreas de trabajo generales (por ejemplo, ventas, operaciones, soporte).
* **Si usas Clockify para rastrear la productividad personal**, puedes nombrar proyectos según la actividad (por ejemplo, correos, trabajo, aprendizaje, cocina).

Clientes, proyectos y tareas #
------------------------------

Proyectos son el método principal de organizar tu tiempo. A un nivel más alto, puedes organizar proyectos alrededor de clientes (o departamentos, o lo que sea). Aprende más sobre la gestión de proyectos.

Los clientes se usan para organizar proyectos. Un cliente puede tener muchos proyectos, pero un proyecto puede pertenecer a un solo cliente.

No es posible añadir solo un cliente a una entrada de tiempo puesto que los clientes se utilizan como un mecanismo de agrupación para proyectos. Sin embargo, puedes crear un proyecto con el nombre de cliente. Alternativamente, puedes crear una etiqueta para cada cliente y añadirla a una entrada de tiempo, para que luego puedas agrupar las entradas por etiquetas.

Si necesitas más control, puedes clasificar las entradas usando tareas (o sea, subproyectos o trabajos) y usarlas para designar el tipo de traba


## Chunk 3

tas.

Si necesitas más control, puedes clasificar las entradas usando tareas (o sea, subproyectos o trabajos) y usarlas para designar el tipo de trabajo (por ejemplo, diseño, escritura, programación) o cualquier otra cosa que quieras (por ejemplo, errores, sprint A, fase X).

Mientras que las tareas se usan para designar el tipo de actividad (por ejemplo, diseño, codificación), el campo de la descripción se usa mayormente para la cosa actual que estás haciendo (por ejemplo, “Corregir error #638).

Cambiar términos #
------------------

Por defecto, el tiempo en Clockify se clasifica por Cliente/Proyecto/Tarea.

Para cambiar estos términos en algo diferente:

1. Ve a Configuración
2. Busca **Organizar el tiempo por**
3. Selecciona lo que quieres renombrar

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/custom-hierarchy.png)

Gestionar clientes #
--------------------

Por defecto, los **propietarios** y los **administradores** pueden crear clientes. Sin embargo, este conjunto de permisos se puede modificar si **Quién puede crear proyectos y clientes** está configurado como **Administradores y gerentes** o **Cualquiera** en la  **Configuración del espacio de trabajo**.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image_1-2.png)

Quién puede crear clientes si se selecciona:

* **Administradores** (por defecto): administradores
* **Administradores y gerentes de


## Chunk 4

/image_1-2.png)

Quién puede crear clientes si se selecciona:

* **Administradores** (por defecto): administradores
* **Administradores y gerentes de proyecto**: administradores y gerentes de proyecto
* **Cualquiera**: administradores, gerentes de proyecto, gerentes de equipo, usuarios regulares

Los usuarios regulares podrán crear clientes cuando creen un nuevo proyecto. Sin embargo, todavía no podrán ver la página de **Clientes**.

### Cómo propietarios, administradores y gerentes de proyecto crean clientes #

Si eres el propietario o un administrador del espacio de trabajo, para crear un cliente simplemente:

1. Ve a la página de **Clientes** en la barra lateral
2. Introduce el nombre del cliente en el campo **Añadir nuevo cliente**

#### Eliminación masiva de clientes #

Si tienes muchos clientes archivados y quieres limpiar tu página de **Clientes,** puedes eliminarlos en masa de la siguiente manera:

1. Marca la casilla de **Nombre** en la página de **Clientes**
2. Haz clic en **Eliminar**
3. Escribe ELIMINAR en las ventanas emergentes
4. Haz clic en **Eliminar** para confirmar la acción

Todos los clientes eliminados serán eliminados de las entradas de tiempo a las que están asignados.

Cuando los proyectos y etiquetas no bastan para mantener las cosas organizadas, usa etiquetas.

Lo mejor de las etiquetas es que están disponibles en todo el espacio de trabajo. Las etiquetas funcionan independientemente del proyecto, así que puedes crear una etiqueta, usarla en varios proyectos y filtrar los informes basados en ellas. Incluso puedes usar múltiples etiquetas para filtrar informes con más precisión.

Las etiquetas también se pueden usar para añadir información adicional sobre las entradas de tiempo. Por ejemplo, puedes:

* Marcar las entradas de tiempo con **tarifas de facturación o monedas no estándar** para saber cómo facturarlas
* Marcar las **entradas de tiempo facturadas** con la etiqueta de **facturado** para no facturar doble a un cliente (puedes usar la


## Chunk 7

r cómo facturarlas
* Marcar las **entradas de tiempo facturadas** con la etiqueta de **facturado** para no facturar doble a un cliente (puedes usar la edición masiva para actualizar varias entradas a la vez)
* Marcar qué **tipo de trabajo o servicio haces** (por ejemplo, gestión de proyectos, feedback, depuración, codificación), así que puedes ver cuánto tiempo tardas en realizar un tipo de trabajo concreto en todos los proyectos
* Marcar en qué **parte del negocio** estás trabajando (por ejemplo, interno, soporte, trabajo con cliente, móvil)
* Marca la cantidad de tiempo que trabajaste las **horas extras**

Las etiquetas son útiles porque las puedes usar como palabras clave según las que puedes filtrar informes para encontrar exactamente lo que necesitas.

Antes de poder utilizar las etiquetas, debes crearlas escribiendo el nuevo nombre de la etiqueta en el selector de etiquetas y presionando **Ctrl / ^ (Control) + Enter**. Una vez creada la etiqueta, todos los usuarios en tu espacio de trabajo la pueden seleccionar al rastrear el tiempo.

Todos pueden crear etiquetas (aunque puedes limitar la creación de etiquetas solo a los administradores en la configuración del espacio de trabajo). Solo los administradores pueden editar y eliminar las etiquetas. Tú puedes crear tantas etiquetas como quieras.

Todas las etiquetas eliminadas se eliminarán de las entradas de tiempo a las que están asignadas.

Puedes filtrar las entradas de tiempo en informes de tres maneras:

* **Contiene**: se mostrarán todas las entradas que contienen esa etiqueta (por ejemplo, si una entrada tiene etiquetas A y B, y tú filtras **Contiene: A**, esa entrada aparecerá)
* **No contiene** – se mostrarán solo las entradas que no tienen esa etiqueta (por ejemplo, si una entrada tiene etiquetas A y B, y tú filtras **No contiene: A**, no aparecerá esa entrada)
* **Contiene solo**: se mostrarán solo las entradas que tienen una etiqueta concreta (por ejemplo, si una entrada tiene la etiqueta A y B, y tú filtras **Contiene: solo A**, no aparecerá esa entrada)

Organización avanzada #
-----------------------

Clockify te permite categorizar el tiempo aún más con campos personalizados.

El campo personalizado es una función de pago que se puede habilitar actualizando al plan PRO.

Los campos personalizados permiten que tus usuarios añadan información adicional a las entradas de tiempo (por ejemplo, gastos, kilometraje, etc.), además de poder auto-clasificar las entradas de tiempo basándose en un proyecto.

Por ejemplo, si algunos proyectos se realizan en una ubicación y los otros en otra, puedes crear un campo personalizado llamado ubicación y poner qué proyecto pertenece a qué ubicación. Entonces, al descargar un informe, podrás crear un informe personalizado, y agrupar y ordenar el tiempo por ubicación.

# Clasificar tiempo usando campos obligatorios y etiquetas - Ayuda de Clockify


## Chunk 1

Campos obligatorios #
---------------------

Los **campos obligatorios** son los campos mínimos que deben rellenarse para crear una entrada de tiempo.
Utiliza los campos obligatorios para evitar entradas de tiempo incompletas, de modo que todas las entradas contengan datos esenciales como proyecto, tarea, etiqueta y descripción, y mejora la precisión y la coherencia de tus informes.

Los campos obligatorios se pueden crear en espacios de trabajo en todos los planes de pago.

Para usar los campos obligatorios como gerente de equipo o proyecto, necesitarás que tu administrador habilite esta función en la Configuración del espacio de trabajo.

### Cómo funcionan los campos obligatorios #

Una vez habilitados los campos obligatorios, ciertos campos deben completarse para poder guardar o rastrear las entradas de tiempo.

Por ejemplo:

*Si el proyecto y la etiqueta están marcados como obligatorios, los usuarios no pueden enviar una entrada de tiempo sin seleccionar un proyecto y una etiqueta. Además, el temporizador no puede detenerse hasta que se asignen un proyecto y una etiqueta. Incluso si el campo de tarea es opcional, los campos de proyecto y etiqueta serán obligatorios.*
*Si una tarea es obligatoria, solo los proyectos con tareas aparecerán en el selector de proyectos. Si no existen tareas para un proyecto, este proyecto no se podrá seleccionar para el control del tiempo.*

**


## Chunk 2

aparecerán en el selector de proyectos. Si no existen tareas para un proyecto, este proyecto no se podrá seleccionar para el control del tiempo.*

**Importante**:

* Solo los **administradores** pueden configurar y modificar los campos obligatorios en la **Configuración del espacio de trabajo**
* Si falta un campo obligatorio, el sistema solicitará al usuario que complete la información faltante antes de finalizar la entrada de tiempo

Las **etiquetas** son una herramienta eficaz para categorizar las entradas de tiempo. Al adjuntarlas, puedes filtrar y generar informes fácilmente sobre distintos tipos de trabajo.
Utiliza las etiquetas para agrupar las entradas de tiempo por tareas específicas, clientes, tipos de proyecto o cualquier otro criterio relevante para tu flujo de trabajo. Las etiquetas facilitan la generación de informes detallados y el análisis de dónde se invierte el tiempo en los distintos proyectos o equipos.

Las etiquetas son **obligatorias** cuando los campos obligatorios están habilitados, lo que garantiza que todas las entradas de tiempo se categoricen correctamente. Puedes usar etiquetas existentes o crear nuevas al introducir tiempo.

1. Ve a la página de Etiquetas en la barra lateral
2. Escribe el nombre de la etiqueta y haz clic en AÑADIR

O bien:

1. Haz clic en el ícono de la etiqueta en la entrada de tiempo
2. Empieza a escribir el nombre de la etique


## Chunk 3

la etiqueta y haz clic en AÑADIR

O bien:

1. Haz clic en el ícono de la etiqueta en la entrada de tiempo
2. Empieza a escribir el nombre de la etiqueta
3. Haz clic en Crear etiqueta o presiona Ctrl/^(Control)+Enter

Todas las etiquetas eliminadas se eliminarán de las entradas de tiempo a las que están asignadas.

* Puedes configurar **etiquetas personalizadas** según las necesidades de tu proyecto
* Las etiquetas se pueden a**signar a proyectos, tareas y entradas de tiempo**, lo que proporciona flexibilidad en la forma de rastrear y reportar el tiempo

* Asegúrate de que todos los miembros del equipo utilicen etiquetas coherentes para facilitar la creación de informes y el análisis
* Crea un sistema de etiquetas (por ejemplo, Cliente A > Investigación > Desarrollo) para mantener las entradas organizadas
* Revisa periódicamente qué campos deben marcarse como obligatorios para adaptarlos a las necesidades cambiantes de tu equipo

Preguntas frecuentes #
----------------------

#### ¿Puedo configurar campos obligatorios para proyectos o tareas individuales? #

No, los campos obligatorios se configuran a **nivel de espacio de trabajo** y se aplican a **todas las entradas de tiempo**. Esto significa que no puedes designar diferentes campos obligatorios para proyectos o tareas individuales. Por ejemplo, si marcas los campos **Proyecto** y **Etiqueta** como obligatorios, todos los usu


## Chunk 4

mpos obligatorios para proyectos o tareas individuales. Por ejemplo, si marcas los campos **Proyecto** y **Etiqueta** como obligatorios, todos los usuarios de todos los proyectos del espacio de trabajo deberán proporcionar un proyecto y una etiqueta al registrar el tiempo, independientemente del proyecto o la tarea específicos. Sin embargo, puedes personalizar los campos obligatorios para todo tu espacio de trabajo eligiendo qué campo (por ejemplo, **Proyecto**, **Tarea**, **Etiqueta** o **Descripción**) es obligatorio para las entradas de tiempo.

#### ¿Puedo deshabilitar los campos obligatorios después de habilitarlos? #

Sí, puedes modificar los campos obligatorios en cualquier momento, pero solo los **administradores** tienen permisos para hacerlo. Si decides que ciertos campos ya no son obligatorios (por ejemplo, si ya no quieres que el campo **Descripción** sea obligatorio), puedes ir a la **Configuración del espacio de trabajo** y deshabilitar ese campo. Sin embargo, ten en cuenta que cualquier cambio realizado en los campos obligatorios se aplicará a **todas las entradas de tiempo futuras**, y las entradas de tiempo ya enviadas (incluso con información faltante) se mantendrán como están.

¡Por supuesto! Las etiquetas son una herramienta potente para **categorizar** y **filtrar** tus entradas de tiempo. Al usar etiquetas de forma consistente en todo el espacio de trabajo


## Chunk 5

na herramienta potente para **categorizar** y **filtrar** tus entradas de tiempo. Al usar etiquetas de forma consistente en todo el espacio de trabajo, puedes generar fácilmente informes basados ​​en las etiquetas que hayas asignado. Por ejemplo, si utilizas etiquetas para diferentes fases del proyecto (por ejemplo, Planificación, Desarrollo y Pruebas), puedes filtrar tus entradas de tiempo para ver cuánto tiempo se dedicó a cada fase. De igual forma, las etiquetas se pueden usar para diferenciar entre clientes, tipos de trabajo (por ejemplo, Facturable, Interno) u otras categorías relevantes.

#### ¿Se pueden aplicar los campos obligatorios a las entradas de tiempo registradas mediante la aplicación móvil o la extensión del navegador? #

Sí, la configuración de los **campos obligatorios** se aplica a las entradas de tiempo realizadas en todas las plataformas, incluyendo la **aplicación móvil** y la **extensión del navegador**. Si intentas registrar el tiempo mediante cualquier dispositivo y no completas los campos obligatorios (como **Proyecto** o **Etiqueta**), se te solicitará que completes la información faltante antes de poder guardar la entrada.

#### ¿Cómo afectan los campos obligatorios a las entradas de tiempo existentes? #

Los campos obligatorios solo afectan a las entradas de tiempo nuevas o actualizadas una vez habilitados. Si los campos obligatorios se configuran


## Chunk 6

#

Los campos obligatorios solo afectan a las entradas de tiempo nuevas o actualizadas una vez habilitados. Si los campos obligatorios se configuran a mitad de un proyecto, las entradas de tiempo ya registradas no los requerirán retroactivamente. Sin embargo, desde el momento en que se activan los campos obligatorios, cualquier **nueva entrada de tiempo** o **actualización de las entradas existentes** deberá cumplir con los nuevos requisitos. Esto garantiza que, a partir de ahora, todos los datos registrados estén completos y organizados.

#### ¿Puedo personalizar qué usuarios se ven afectados por los campos obligatorios? #

No, los campos obligatorios se aplican a todos los usuarios del espacio de trabajo una vez habilitados, independientemente de su rol (por ejemplo, administrador, gerente de proyectos, miembro del equipo).
Para obtener ayuda adicional o para configurar los campos y etiquetas obligatorios según las necesidades específicas de tu espacio de trabajo, siempre puedes comunicarte con el **administrador de tu espacio de trabajo** o consultar nuestro **Centro de ayuda** para obtener instrucciones detalladas y mejores prácticas.

# Clockify-Benachrichtigungen in der Pumble-App - Clockify-Hilfe


## Chunk 1

Erhalte wichtige Benachrichtigungen von Clockify direkt in der Pumble-App, unserer integrierten Plattform für geschäftliche Kommunikation. So bleibt dein Team stets informiert und kann schnell handeln, ohne das Kommunikationstool verlassen zu müssen.

Wie es funktioniert  #
----------------------

Clockify sendet die wichtigsten Benachrichtigungen (Erinnerungen an die Arbeitszeiterfassung, Urlaubs- und Genehmigungsupdates) direkt in deinen Pumble-Arbeitsbereich. So bleibst du auf dem Laufenden mit allen Aktivitäten in deinem Team, ohne deine E-Mails ständig überprüfen zu müssen.

Benachrichtigungen erhalten #
-----------------------------

Wenn du wenigstens einen aktiven Clockify-Arbeitsbereich und einen aktiven Pumble-Arbeitsbereich **in derselben CAKE.com-Organisation** hast, erhältst du automatisch Benachrichtigungen von Clockify in Pumble.

1. Zu **Profileinstellungen** in Clockify gehen
2. Das Menü öffnen
3. Zu **Persönlichen Einstellungen** navigieren und das Tab **Pumble-Benachrichtigungen** wählen
4. Auf **Pumble ausprobieren** klicken

Manager und Admins erhalten auch:

* Zeiterfassungsübersichten für ihre Teams
* Genehmigungsanfragen für eingereichte Arbeitszeittabellen und Abwesenheitsanträge
* Updates für Abwesenheitsanträge

Manager und Administratoren können in Clockify eingereichte Anträge direkt aus den Pumble-Nachrichten, die sie erhalten, genehmigen, ablehnen oder zurückziehen.

Benachrichtigungen stoppen #
----------------------------

Wenn du keine Pumble-Benachrichtigungen mehr erhalten möchtest:

# Clockify subscription issues - Clockify Help


## Chunk 1

This article covers the most common subscription-related issues and explains how to resolve them.

I’m being charged for more seats than I have team members #
-----------------------------------------------------------

Clockify subscriptions are seat-based, which means that every active seat in your workspace is billed, regardless of whether a user is currently deactivated.

If you’ve deactivated users on the Team page but haven’t adjusted your seat count, those seats will still remain on your subscription and continue to be charged. To lower your costs for the next billing cycle, you’ll need to remove the extra seats manually.

Here’s how:

1. Go to your Workspace Settings by clicking on the three dots next to your workspace name
2. Select Subscription
3. Find the current seat count and click Remove next to it
4. Confirm the change

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image.png)

If the Remove button is grayed out, that means you still have active users occupying all seats. In that case, first go to the Team page, find the user you’d like to deactivate, click the three dots next to their name, and select Deactivate. Then return to the Subscription page to remove the seat.

I can’t add or remove seats #
-----------------------------

If the option to remove or add seats is grayed out on your Subscription page, there are a couple of possible reasons:

* **You’re paying via wire transfer**

In this case, you won’t be able to manage seats directly from the app. Instead, you can either:

* Contact us at support@clockify.me, and we’ll add the seats for you and issue an updated invoice. The minimum number of seats is five (5).
* Or, if you’d prefer self-service, add credit card details to your account and purchase additional seats with the card.

Clockify subscriptions are billed by credit card. Special conditions apply for wire transfer payments. If you’d like to explore this option for larger purchases, please contact sales@clockify.me.

When there’s an unpaid invoice on your account, the option to remove seats is disabled. To fix this:

* Process the latest invoice from your Invoices page.
* Or, reach out to our support team at support@clockify.me and we’ll help you resolve it.

Once the issue is cleared, you’ll be able to add or remove seats normally.

If your invoice is overdue and you’d like to reduce the number of seats, our team can void the unpaid invoice and downgrade your workspace to the Free plan. From there, you’ll be able to upgrade again with the preferred number of seats.

Please keep in mind th

and downgrade your workspace to the Free plan. From there, you’ll be able to upgrade again with the preferred number of seats.

Please keep in mind that this process may slightly change your settings and billing cycle (for example, you may need to re-enable certain paid features).

My payment failed #
-------------------

If you have a valid subscription but your payment fails (for example, due to incorrect payment information, insufficient funds, or an expired credit card), you’ll enter a two-week grace period. During this time:

1. Go to the Subscription page
2. Update your payment information
3. Retry the payment manually, or wait for our payment processor to automatically retry the transaction

If the payment isn’t processed by the end of the grace period, your workspace will be downgraded to the free plan. You won’t lose any data, but you will lose access to paid features.

If you are unsure why your payment failed, here are a few things to check:

* **3D Secure**: Make sure 3D Secure is enabled on your card. Without it, online transactions may be declined.
* **Online payments**: Confirm your card is authorized for online payments. Some cards have restrictions or require prior approval for internet transactions.
* I**ssuing bank**: Contact your bank to verify there aren’t any blocks or restrictions on your card.

ank**: Contact your bank to verify there aren’t any blocks or restrictions on your card.

Once everything is confirmed and corrected, retry updating your payment method on the Subscription page.

My subscription renewed on an expired card #
--------------------------------------------

If your subscription was renewed using a card that has technically expired, this happens because of how payment processing works between Stripe (our payment processor) and your issuing bank.

* Clockify uses Stripe as a payment processor. If a card was saved in Stripe before its expiration date, Stripe may still attempt charges after it expires. Whether the charge goes through depends entirely on the issuing bank.
* In many cases, banks allow these charges to succeed to avoid disrupting recurring payments, giving customers time to update their payment method.
* If you’d like to prevent this from happening again, we recommend updating your payment information on the Subscription page with your new card details.

I can’t change the country on the customer information page #
-------------------------------------------------------------

If you’d like to update the country in your billing details, keep in mind:

* Customers can’t change the country field themselves
* If no country is set, or if you need to switch to a different one, please reach out to our support team at support@clockify.me

* If no country is set, or if you need to switch to a different one, please reach out to our support team at support@clockify.me

Changing the country may also change the currency of your subscription, which requires adjustments to your billing setup from our team.

Instalar complementos privados #
--------------------------------

Para melhorar a segurança da sua integração, você pode criar complementos privados diretamente no portal do desenvolvedor.

Lembre-se de colocar seu espaço de trabalho Clockify na lista de permissões durante o processo de lançamento do complemento.

Para instalar e usar seu complemento privado com sucesso, siga estas etapas:

1. Adicione seu espaço de trabalho Clockify à lista de permissões ao criar um complemento privado no portal do desenvolvedor
2. Você receberá um e-mail confirmando a inclusão na lista de permissões, que inclui um botão **Exibir complemento**
3. Clique neste botão para ser redirecionado para a página de visualização do seu complemento privado no Marketplace (ex.: https://marketplace.cake.com/addons/966b331c-6958-4dd9-a5ab-813cfa9811c5)
4. Por fim, clique no botão **Instalar** (como faria com qualquer complemento disponível publicamente)
5. Escolha seu espaço de trabalho para concluir a instalação

Se você ver um erro **Esta página não existe**, certifique-se de estar conectado a CAKE.com Marketplace com a conta Clockify correta.

Informações de pagamento preenchidos #

## Chunk 6

Após a finalização do pagamento, todas as informações do cliente e de pagamento serão preenchidas: **Informações do cliente**, **Informações da fatura** e **Informações de pagamento**.

### Guia Informações do cliente e de pagamento #

Informações sobre dados de clientes e pagamentos podem ser editadas a qualquer momento. No entanto, somente o proprietário do espaço de trabalho pode editar as informações do cliente.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/customer_and_payment_no-banner-1024x741.png)

Lembre-se de que, nesta etapa, você pode alterar o **País** mesmo se tiver selecionado **Pessoa Física** como **Tipo de cliente**. Desta forma, você pode ter dois países: um como informação do cliente e outro como modal de informação de pagamento.

### Importante lembrar: #

* Se um complemento já estiver instalado em um espaço de trabalho, esse espaço de trabalho será desativado no menu suspenso.
* Para espaços de trabalho em regiões específicas, o complemento pode não salvar os dados devido às regulamentações de proteção de dados. *Isso significa que o Clockify não tem conhecimento de onde os dados do complemento são armazenados. Os complementos podem armazenar dados em regiões diferentes da região do espaço de trabalho.*

# Comece a usar os relatórios de membros do espaço de trabalho Clockify


## Chunk 1

Como administrador ou proprietário de um espaço de trabalho, gerenciar relatórios é fundamental para monitorar o tempo registrado, o andamento do projeto e a produtividade da equipe. O Clockify oferece diferentes tipos de relatórios que ajudam você a acompanhar as horas de trabalho e as despesas da sua equipe. Este guia explicará como usar esses relatórios, personalizá-los e exportá-los para uma análise mais aprofundada.

Permissões de acesso #
----------------------

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Quem pode... | Visualizar e exportar todos os relatórios | Gerenciar todos os relatórios | Editar as entradas de tempo |
| Administrador/proprietário do espaço de trabalho | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Gerente de equipe | X\* | X | X |
| Usuário comum | X\*\* | X | X |

\***O Gerente de equipe**pode visualizar relatórios de sua equipe, mas não tem permissão para gerenciar relatórios de todo o ambiente de trabalho.
\*\***Usuários comuns** só podem visualizar suas próprias entradas de tempo nos relatórios.

Tipos de relatórios no Clockify #
---------------------------------

O Clockify fornece três tipos principais de relatórios, cada um atendendo a propósitos diferentes com base em como você deseja analisar o trabalho da sua equipe:

### Relatório resumido #

## Chunk 2

latório resumido #

O relatório resumido é altamente flexível e permite que você agrupe os registros de tempo da sua equipe de diversas maneiras, dependendo das suas necessidades. Você pode agrupar os dados por:

* Projeto
* Cliente
* Usuário
* Grupo
* Etiqueta
* Mês, Semana ou Data

Como usar o **Relatório resumido**:

* **Agrupar por Usuário**: Obtenha um detalhamento das horas dos seus funcionários por usuário, projeto e tarefa. Essa visualização ajuda você a ver quanto tempo cada membro da equipe gastou em projetos ou tarefas específicas.
* **Agrupar por Data**: Veja quantas horas cada funcionário registrou em um dia específico. Isso é ideal se você precisa de um relatório diário, quinzenal ou mensal.
* Você pode selecionar qualquer intervalo de datas no canto superior direito do relatório para obter uma visualização personalizada das horas da sua equipe.

### Relatório semanal #

O **relatório semanal** concentra-se nas horas monitoradas em uma semana específica. É útil para o acompanhamento semanal e aprovação de fluxos de trabalho.

Como usar o relatório semanal:

* **Agrupar por usuário ou projeto**: Você pode visualizar as horas com base em usuários individuais ou projetos específicos.
* O relatório sempre mostra os dados de uma semana por vez. No entanto, se quiser ver mais de uma semana, você pode usar o Relatório resumido e agrupar por Usuário e Data para ver as hor


## Chunk 3

de uma semana por vez. No entanto, se quiser ver mais de uma semana, você pode usar o Relatório resumido e agrupar por Usuário e Data para ver as horas por dia em váriass semanas.

### Relatório detalhado #

O  **Relatório detalhado** fornece uma visão linha a linha de todos os registros de tempo da sua equipe, sem qualquer agrupamento ou resumo. Este relatório é ideal para visualizar todo o tempo rastreado em detalhes e fazer ajustes nos registros.

Como usar o Relatório detalhado:

* Veja todas as entradas de tempo registradas pela sua equipe
* Os administradores podem editar os registros de tempo dos membros da equipe diretamente no Relatório detalhado
* Este relatório pode ser exportado em vários formatos, como PDF, Excel ou CSV

Gerenciar relatórios individuais de funcionários #
--------------------------------------------------

Se precisar obter dados de um único funcionário, você pode filtrar relatórios por usuário para gerar um relatório específico para as horas daquele indivíduo.

Etapas para gerar um relatório individual de um funcionário:

1. Abra o **Relatório resumido, o Relatório detalhado ou o Relatório semanal**
2. Aplique o filtro de usuário para selecionar um funcionário específico
3. Visualize o relatório de horas desse funcionário e exporte ou analise os dados conforme necessário

Personalizar relatórios #

oras desse funcionário e exporte ou analise os dados conforme necessário

Personalizar relatórios #
-------------------------

Os relatórios integrados do Clockify são flexíveis, mas se você precisar de ainda mais personalização, pode exportar o Relatório detalhado e criar relatórios personalizados usando ferramentas como tabelas dinâmicas no Excel ou Planilhas Google.

Para personalizar relatórios:

1. Exporte o Relatório detalhado em formato CSV
2. Abra o arquivo no Excel ou no Planilhas Google
3. Use tabelas dinâmicas ou outras ferramentas de análise para organizar os dados no formato exato que você precisa

Isso é particularmente útil se você quiser criar relatórios mais complexos ou precisar combinar dados de diferentes fontes.

Visualizar e gerenciar planilhas de horas #
-------------------------------------------

Se o seu espaço de trabalho estiver em um plano pago, você poderá acessar os Quadros de Horários dos seus funcionários. Este recurso fornece um resumido das horas de cada membro da equipe, semelhante ao relatório semanal, mas em um formato mais estruturado.

Para acessar e gerenciar as planilhas de horas:

1. Acesse a página **Planilha**
2. Use filtros para selecionar um funcionário específico e agrupar a planilha de horas por Projeto
3. Você pode exportar a planilha de horas como PDF para imprimir ou salvar facilmente

Trabalho atual e tempo rastreado #

## Chunk 5

de horas por Projeto
3. Você pode exportar a planilha de horas como PDF para imprimir ou salvar facilmente

Trabalho atual e tempo rastreado #
----------------------------------

Você pode monitorar as atividades da sua equipe em tempo real e verificar se há discrepâncias no tempo registrado por meio do Painel.

Para visualizar os cronômetros ativos:

1. Navegue até o painel da Equipe
2. Na seção Última atividade, você verá os cronômetros ativos de todos os funcionários
3. Você também pode ver quem não registrou o tempo em um intervalo de datas específico filtrando a coluna Total rastreado

Esta é uma ótima maneira de identificar rapidamente se os membros da equipe estão cumprindo suas metas de tempo semanais ou mensais.

Notifique os funcionários sobre problemas de controle de tempo #
----------------------------------------------------------------

O Clockify oferece lembretes automáticos para membros da equipe que estão abaixo ou acima das metas de tempo.

Defina lembretes para os funcionários:

1. Defina metas de controle de tempo (por exemplo, 8 horas por dia)
2. Se alguém se esquecer de registrar seu tempo, o Clockify enviará um lembrete por e-mail
3. Se um funcionário exceder sua meta de tempo, você, como administrador, receberá uma notificação por e-mail sobre o excesso

## Chunk 6

ceberá uma notificação por e-mail sobre o excesso

Solução de problemas #
----------------------

Às vezes, os funcionários podem relatar horas de rastreamento que não aparecem nos seus relatórios. Isso geralmente ocorre porque eles registram o tempo em um espaço de trabalho diferente (como o espaço de trabalho pessoal deles).

Certifique-se de que os funcionários estejam monitorando seu tempo no espaço de trabalho correto. Quando os usuários criam uma conta no Clockify, eles recebem um espaço de trabalho pessoal por padrão. Se estiverem trabalhando em um projeto de equipe, devem monitorar o tempo no espaço de trabalho para o qual você os convidou.

Exportar relatórios #
---------------------

Você pode exportar todos os tipos de relatórios (Resumido, Semanal, Detalhado) nos seguintes formatos:

Isso é útil para compartilhar relatórios com sua equipe, clientes ou para fins de arquivamento.

### Próximos passos: #

* Defina  **metas** para controle de tempo e garanta que sua equipe as cumpra
* Exporte relatórios importantes e use tabelas dinâmicas para personalizar sua análise

Perguntas frequentes #
----------------------

## Chunk 8

espaço de trabalho correto. Usuários do Clockify podem acidentalmente registrar o tempo em seu espaço de trabalho pessoal em vez do espaço de trabalho para o qual você os convidou.

#### Posso alterar o intervalo de datas no relatório semanal? #

O **Relatório semanal** é fixo para exibir dados de uma semana por vez. Se precisar analisar mais de uma semana, use o **Relatório resumido**. Você pode selecionar qualquer intervalo de datas e agrupar os dados por Usuário e Data para ver o total de horas rastreadas a cada dia em um período personalizado.

#### Posso editar o tempo de um funcionário no Relatório detalhado? #

Sim, como administrador, você pode editar as entradas de tempo de qualquer funcionário diretamente no **Relatório detalhado**. Este recurso permite corrigir erros ou fazer ajustes nas entradas de tempo, se necessário. Para editar o tempo, basta clicar na entrada e fazer as alterações necessárias.

#### Como posso ver se meus funcionários estão atingindo suas metas de tempo? #

Você pode definir **metas de controle de tempo** (por exemplo, 8 horas por dia) para sua equipe. Se os funcionários não atingirem a meta ou a excederem, o Clockify enviará notificações por e-mail. Você também pode acompanhar o progresso deles no Painel, visualizando a coluna **Total rastreado** para ver quem atingiu ou não suas metas.

#### E se eu precisar gerar um relatório para um período


## Chunk 9

o Painel, visualizando a coluna **Total rastreado** para ver quem atingiu ou não suas metas.

#### E se eu precisar gerar um relatório para um período específico? #

O Clockify permite que você especifique qualquer intervalo de datas para seus relatórios:

* No Relatório resumido, você pode definir um intervalo de datas personalizado usando o seletor de datas no canto superior direito
* No Relatório semanal, você precisa selecionar a semana específica que deseja revisar

Para relatórios mais detalhados por um período mais longo, o Relatório resumido é a melhor opção, pois permite maior flexibilidade no ajuste do intervalo de datas.

#### Posso exportar registros de tempo de um projeto ou cliente específico? #

Sim, no Relatório resumido, você pode agrupar dados por Projeto ou Cliente e, em seguida, exportar os resultados. Você pode selecionar o intervalo de datas e as opções de agrupamento relevantes para obter os registros de tempo relacionados a esse projeto ou cliente específico.

#### Posso rastrear despesas nos relatórios? #

Sim, se o seu espaço de trabalho estiver atualizado com o plano PRO ou outro plano superior, você também poderá rastrear e gerar relatórios de despesas. O **Relatório detalhado** permite que você veja as despesas juntamente com os registros de tempo. Administradores e gerentes de equipe também podem gerenciar e editar despesas neste relatório.

1. O horário pode ser editado novamente para ajustes posteriores
2. Um registro permanente da aprovação retirada, incluindo todos os registros de tempo, é criado na aba **Retirada** para fins de auditoria
3. Tanto o administrador quanto o funcionário receberão uma notificação por e-mail explicando o motivo da retirada da aprovação

#### Como posso ter certeza de que os dados nos meus relatórios são precisos? #

Para garantir a precisão dos seus dados:

* Verifique regularmente as **Planilhas de horas** para verificar se há entradas incorretas ou ausentes
* Use as **Aprovações** para garantir que as entradas de horas sejam verificadas pelos gerentes de equipe
* Use o **Relatório detalhado** para verificar discrepâncias ou ajustes manuais nas entradas de horas

### Ce qu'il faut retenir #

* Si un module complémentaire est déjà installé dans un espace de travail, cet espace de travail sera désactivé dans la liste déroulante
* Pour les espaces de travail situés dans des régions spécifiques, le module complémentaire peut ne pas sauvegarder les données en raison des réglementations sur la protection des données. *Cela signifie que Clockify n'a aucune idée de l'endroit où les données des modules complémentaires sont stockées. Les modules complémentaires peuvent stocker des données dans des régions différentes de celle de l'espace de travail.*

Dépannage #
-----------

Dans le cas improbable d'une erreur survenant au cours du processus d'installation, un **écran de maintenance** du module complémentaire s'affichera pour vous informer que l'installation est temporairement indisponible.

# Comment Clockify traite vos données


## Chunk 1

Clockify prend la sécurité des données très au sérieux et donne aux utilisateurs un contrôle total sur la manière dont leurs données sont stockées, consultées et exportées. Voici comment les données sont traitées et comment vous pouvez créer vos propres sauvegardes si nécessaire.

Est-ce que mes données sont sécurisées dans Clockify ? #
--------------------------------------------------------

Les données Clockify sont hébergées en toute sécurité sur Amazon Web Services (AWS) et protégées à la fois physiquement et électroniquement. Toutes les connexions entre vous et Clockify sont cryptées à l’aide d’un cryptage SSL 256 bits, la même norme que celle utilisée dans les services bancaires en ligne.

Bien que nous effectuions régulièrement des sauvegardes au niveau de l’infrastructure, Clockify n’offre pas de récupération par compte dans les cas où les données sont accidentellement supprimées ou écrasées par les utilisateurs. Pour cette raison, il est fortement recommandé de créer régulièrement des sauvegardes personnelles de vos données.

Vous pouvez en savoir plus sur les mesures de sécurité ici.

Quelles données Clockify collecte-t-il ? #
------------------------------------------

Clockify ne stocke que les données que vous fournissez activement ou auxquelles vous consentez :

* Les cookies sont utilisés pour les sessions de connexion.
* Google Analytics suit les pages du site


## Chunk 2

ssez activement ou auxquelles vous consentez :

* Les cookies sont utilisés pour les sessions de connexion.
* Google Analytics suit les pages du site web qui sont visitées (de manière anonyme).
* La saisie manuelle est requise pour le suivi du temps. Clockify n’enregistre pas automatiquement les données, sauf si vous l’activez.
* La détection d’inactivité et le suivi automatique sont des fonctionnalités optionnelles. Les données issues de ces fonctionnalités restent privées et ne sont visibles que par l’utilisateur.
* Les captures d’écran et le suivi de localisation ne sont collectés que s’ils sont explicitement activés par un administrateur. Tous les utilisateurs sont informés lorsque ces fonctionnalités sont activées.
* Le suivi de localisation s’applique à l’appli mobile (si les autorisations sont accordées).
* Les captures d’écran sont collectées via l’appli de bureau (si elle est installée et en marche).

Vous pouvez à tout moment supprimer votre compte et toutes les données associées. Pour plus d’informations, consultez notre Politique de confidentialité.

Exporter ses données pour les sauvegarder personnellement #
-----------------------------------------------------------

Vous pouvez exporter toutes vos données de suivi du temps à tout moment à l’aide du rapport détaillé :

1. Accédez à la page des rapports et sélectionnez **Rapport détaillé**
2. Définissez la plage de


## Chunk 3

u temps à tout moment à l’aide du rapport détaillé :

1. Accédez à la page des rapports et sélectionnez **Rapport détaillé**
2. Définissez la plage de dates la plus longue possible à partir du calendrier
3. Exportez au format CSV

Cette exportation contient toutes les données pertinentes relatives aux saisies de temps et peut servir d’archive personnelle ou de point de restauration.

La création d’exportations périodiques vous permet de contrôler entièrement vos enregistrements et constitue une protection contre les suppressions accidentelles ou les réinitialisations de l’espace de travail.

## Chunk 1

Comment configurer une politique ?
==================================

Dans Clockify, vous pouvez configurer deux types de politiques sur la page **Congés**.

Politiques relatives aux jours fériés #
---------------------------------------

Les politiques relatives aux jours fériés s’appliquent aux jours fériés tels que Noël, le jour de l’An ou tout autre jour férié observé par votre organisation.

* Lorsque vous attribuez une politique de congés à des utilisateurs, ceux-ci sont automatiquement marqués comme absents à ces dates.
* Les jours fériés seront visibles dans la feuille de temps, le calendrier, les approbations et les rapports si la création automatique de saisie de congés est activée.
* Les utilisateurs n’ont pas besoin de soumettre de demande, le processus est automatique.

Vous pouvez également choisir si les jours fériés :

* Ont lieu chaque année
* Créent automatiquement des saisies de temps le jour du jour férié

Politiques relatives aux congés #
---------------------------------

Les politiques relatives aux congés sont utilisées pour les demandes soumises par les utilisateurs, telles que les vacances, les arrêts maladie, les congés personnels, etc.

* L’utilisateur doit soumettre une demande afin de prendre un congé.
* Le congé ne sera comptabilisé qu’une fois la demande approuvée (si nécessaire).

* Création automatique des entrées de temps une fois approuvées
* Autorisation des soldes négatifs

**Comment créer une politique (les deux types)**

1. Accédez à la page **Congés**
2. Cliquez sur l’icône en forme de roue dentée dans le coin supérieur droit
3. Sélectionnez **Gérer les congés** ou **Gérer les politiques**
4. Dans la fenêtre contextuelle, sélectionnez **Créer**

# Common errors and issues - Clockify Help


## Chunk 1

Start time is greater than end time  #
--------------------------------------

This error occurs when the start time in your API request is after the end time, often due to a mismatch between local time zones and UTC, which is what the Clockify API expects.

Why this happens:

* The Clockify API uses UTC time for all time-based values
* Sending a start time in local time (e.g., Brussels +1) without converting it to UTC may result in a start time that appears later than the end time.

How to fix it:

* Make sure both start and end times in your request are converted to UTC.
* Double-check the full API request:
  + Endpoint used
  + Request body and time fields
  + Headers (especially Content-Type and authentication)
  + Time zone settings on the server or script generating the request

Even if a non-UTC start time is accepted, the timer might begin with a negative duration, which can affect calculations and reporting. Converting to UTC resolves this issue completely.

403 – Forbidden #
-----------------

This error means your request is understood by the server, but you’re not authorized to perform the action due to missing permissions or feature restrictions.

Why this happens:

* The API key being used doesn’t have permission for the requested operation
* The user’s role (e.g., Project Manager or a Team Manager) has limited access
* The subscription plan doesn’t include the re


## Chunk 2

the requested operation
* The user’s role (e.g., Project Manager or a Team Manager) has limited access
* The subscription plan doesn’t include the requested feature
* You’re requesting a report with amounts, but you don’t have permission to view amounts

How to fix it:

* Check user role and permissions:

Make sure the API key belongs to a user with the correct role and access to the resource.

Some endpoints and features require a paid plan, like “Add time for others”, for example.

1. Click on your Profile picture and select Preferences
2. Open the Advanced tab
3. Click Generate next to the API key field

* If generating a report as a Project or a Team Manager:

If amounts are restricted and you don’t have access, use the following parameter in your request:

“amountShown”: “HIDE\_AMOUNT”

This will generate the report without including financial data.

401 – Unauthorized #
--------------------

This error means authentication failed, usually because the API key is missing, invalid, or not authorized to access the requested source.

Why this happens:

* API key is missing, invalid, or incorrectly passed in the header
* API key is associated with a user who doesn’t have access to the endpoint
* The current subscription plan doesn’t support the requested feature

How to fix it:

* Verify that the API key is included correctly

X-Api-Key: your\_api\_key

* Check that the API ke


## Chunk 3

n’t support the requested feature

How to fix it:

* Verify that the API key is included correctly

X-Api-Key: your\_api\_key

* Check that the API key is valid:

1. Click on your profile picture and select Preferences
2. Open the Advanced tab
3. Click Generate to create a new API key

* Ensure correct permissions

The user tied to the API key must have access to the requested workspace, project, or feature.

Some API endpoints are only available on paid plans, like “Add time for others”, for example.

400 – Required token or API key and 1000 – Full authentication required #
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This error appears when the request is missing an authentication header, meaning the system doesn’t know who is making the request.

Why this happens:

* The API call is missing the X-Api-Key in the headers
* The request might be sent from a script or tool that didn’t properly include authentication info

How to fix it:

Include the following header in your request:

X-Api-Key: your\_api\_key

¿Cómo añadir gastos para miembros limitados mediante la API?
============================================================

Este artículo te guiará a través del proceso de añadir gastos para miembros limitados utilizando la API de Clockify.

Añadir gastos para miembros limitados #
---------------------------------------

* **Obtener los ID de usuario de los miembros limitados**:
  + Ya que el endpoint `GET /workspaces/{workspaceId}/users` no proporciona información sobre los miembros limitados, debes extraer **los ID de usuario** del endpoint de grupos de usuarios
* **Obtener el ID de categoría del gasto**:
  + Utiliza el siguiente endpoint para obtener el ID de categoría:
    - `GET /workspaces/{workspaceId}/expenses/categories`
  + Asegúrate de elegir la categoría correcta para el gasto
* **Crea el gasto**:
  + Una vez que tengas el ID de categoría, puedes crear un gasto utilizando el siguiente endpoint:
    - `POST /workspaces/{workspaceId}/expenses`
  + Recuerda enviar la solicitud en el **formato de form-data**, no en formato de JSON
  + Incluye el ID de usuario del miembro limitado, el ID de categoría y otros detalles del gasto en el cuerpo

Si la solicitud se realiza correctamente, recibirás un código de estado `201 Created` status code.
El gasto se creará para el miembro limitado como se esperaba.

Você também pode escolher se o feriado:

* Ocorre anualmente
* Cria automaticamente entradas de tempo no dia do feriado

Políticas de folga #

¿Cómo crear una lista de proyectos con personas asignadas mediante la API?
==========================================================================

Si quieres crear una lista de proyectos con las personas asignadas, sigue estos pasos:

* **Herramientas**:
  + Necesitarás Postman (u otra herramienta API) para realizar llamadas API
  + Convierte las respuestas JSON a formato CSV para facilitar su manejo en Excel (por ejemplo, usa konklone, u otra herramienta de conversión)
* **Llamadas API**:
  + Usa los dos endpoints siguientes:
    - `GET /v1/users` - Para obtener información de los usuarios
    - `GET /v1/projects` - Para obtener información de los proyectos
  + Ten en cuenta **el tamaño y el número de página**  al obtener los datos del proyecto para asegurarte de recuperar todos los proyectos
* **Convertir datos a CSV:**:
  + En **Postman**, exporta las respuestas a JSON
  + Utiliza **konklone.io** para convertir cada respuesta JSON a un archivo CSV
* **Combinar datos en Excel**:
  + Abre los dos archivos CSV en **Excel**
  + Utiliza **el formato condicional de Excel** para que coincidan los ID de usuario en el CSV del proyecto con los nombres de usuario (o correos electrónicos) correspondientes del CSV del usuario
  + Es posible que debas ajustar el tamaño de las celdas para ver todos los datos o separar los ID de usuario en varias celdas

https://clockify.me/help/pt/getting-started/track-your-time-as-regular-user/

# Como monitorar suas horas Clockify


## Chunk 1

Com o Clockify, você pode monitorar facilmente o tempo gasto em diversas atividades, seja usando o aplicativo Web, a extensão para navegador, o aplicativo para desktop ou o aplicativo móvel. Este guia aborda os princípios básicos do controle de tempo, incluindo como iniciar e parar cronômetros, gerenciar entradas de tempo e usar recursos adicionais que facilitam o controle.

Configurar o controle de tempo #
--------------------------------

Antes de começar a monitorar o tempo, você precisa garantir que o Rastreador esteja ativado e acessível no seu espaço de trabalho.

#### Para acessar a página do Rastreador de tempo: #

1. **Faça login na sua conta** e navegue até seu espaço de trabalho
2. Na barra lateral, clique em Rastreador para acessar a página.

Quando estiver na página do Rastreador de tempo, você estará pronto para começar a monitorar seu tempo.

### Escolha sua plataforma de controle de tempo #

Você pode controlar o tempo usando uma das seguintes plataformas:

Todos os dados rastreados são sincronizados on-line, para que você possa acessar suas entradas de tempo de qualquer dispositivo.

Acompanhe o tempo com o cronômetro #
------------------------------------

### Iniciar cronômetro #

Para começar a monitorar seu tempo, siga estas etapas:

2. Insira os detalhes da atividade (opcional):
   * Em que você está trabalhando?: Digite uma descrição da sua atividade
   * Projeto/Tarefa: Selecione ou crie um projeto/tarefa em que você está trabalhando
   * Faturabilidade: Escolha se o tempo é faturável
   * Etiquetas: Adicione quaisquer etiquetas relevantes para categorizar a atividade
      Observação: Verifique com seu gerente se existe algum tipo de fluxo de trabalho predefinido que você deva seguir ao inserir os detalhes do registro de horas.

Clique em INICIAR para começar a monitorar o tempo.

### Parar o cronômetro #

Quando você terminar sua tarefa:

1. Volte para a página do Rastreador
2. Clique no botão PARAR para parar o cronômetro.

O cronômetro continuará funcionando até que você o interrompa manualmente. Se você sair da página ou fechar o navegador, o cronômetro continuará funcionando, a menos que você esteja usando a extensão do navegador (que pode interrompê-lo automaticamente).

Quando o cronômetro estiver em execução, um ícone da aba do Clockify aparece na sua aba do navegador. Isso o ajuda a saber se o cronômetro ainda está ativo, evitando omissões acidentais.

3. Faça as alterações editando diretamente os dados da entrada
4. Abra o menu de três pontos para ver mais maneiras de modificar sua entrada

### Editar, dividir ou duplicar entradas em massa #

Você pode gerenciar várias entradas de tempo ao mesmo tempo:

* Edição em massa: Selecione várias entradas e aplique as alterações (por exemplo, atualizar projeto/tarefa, faturamento).
* Dividir entrada: Divida uma entrada de tempo longa em várias entradas menores.
* Duplicar entrada: Crie uma cópia de uma entrada de tempo existente para reutilizá-la em tarefas semelhantes.

### Excluir ou desfazer entradas de tempo #

Como o Clockify lida com seus dados
===================================

O Clockify leva a segurança de dados a sério e oferece aos usuários controle total sobre como seus dados são armazenados, acessados e exportados. Veja como os dados são tratados e como você pode criar seus próprios backups quando necessário.

Meus dados estão seguros no Clockify? #
---------------------------------------

Os dados do Clockify são hospedados com segurança na Amazon Web Services (AWS) e protegidos tanto física quanto eletronicamente. Todas as conexões entre você e o Clockify são criptografadas usando criptografia SSL de 256 bits, o mesmo padrão usado em serviços bancários online.

Embora realizemos backups regulares em nível de infraestrutura, o Clockify não oferece recuperação por conta em casos em que os dados sejam excluídos ou substituídos acidentalmente pelos usuários. Por esse motivo, é altamente recomendável criar backups pessoais dos seus dados regularmente.

  + `page-size=<desired_size>` (máximo 5000 para endpoints base y 1000 para endpoints de informe)
* Por ejemplo:
  + Para recuperar más de 50 entradas de tiempo, utiliza:
```
https://api.clockify.me/api/v1/workspaces/{WorkspaceID}/user/{UserID}/time-entries?page=2&page-size=200
```

#### **Para solicitudes POST:**

* **Ajusta la `página` y el `tamaño de la página`**:
  + En la carga útil de la solicitud, en la sección `detailedFilter,` especifica la página y el tamaño de la página.
* Por ejemplo:
```
{

# Compartilhar relatórios Clockify


## Chunk 1

Se quiser compartilhar seu relatório, você pode enviar um link privado do relatório para que outras pessoas possam acessar os dados em tempo real, mesmo que não tenham uma conta Clockify.

Esta é uma ferramenta **gratuita** disponível em todos os planos de assinatura.

Compartilhar relatório #
------------------------

1. Personalizar relatório (filtrar, escolher intervalo de datas, agrupar, classificar, arredondar, mostrar/ocultar valor)
2. Clicar no ícone de compartilhamento (localizado entre Imprimir e Arredondar)
3. Digitar o nome do relatório (isso será exibido como título do relatório no cabeçalho e na exportação para PDF)
4. Escolher quem pode abrir o link (público/privado) e se o intervalo de datas pode ser alterado (bloquear datas)
5. Clique em **Criar Link**
6. Copiar o link e enviar para outras pessoas

**A opção Bloquear datas** impede que os demais acessem outros intervalos de data no relatório compartilhado. Esta opção vem desativada por padrão, para que os leitores possam passar por diferentes intervalos de datas ao visualizar o relatório.

Se você selecionar um intervalo de data relativo (Esta semana, Mês passado, etc.) em vez de um intervalo de data personalizado, também terá a **opção Sempre abrir como…** Isso significa que o relatório sempre será exibido para o último ou atual dia, semana ou mês quando aberto (que você pode alterar dependendo das configuraçõe


## Chunk 2

gnifica que o relatório sempre será exibido para o último ou atual dia, semana ou mês quando aberto (que você pode alterar dependendo das configurações da opção de datas bloqueadas).

Por exemplo, se estiver visualizando um relatório do **Último mês** de maio, ao clicar em **Compartilhe** , você terá a opção **Sempre abrir como...** habilitada por padrão. Se você desativar essa opção, o relatório sempre mostrará o mês de maio quando aberto.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image_1-3.png)

Relatórios compartilhados – resumo #
------------------------------------

Você pode acessar todos os relatórios que criou ou que alguém compartilhou com você na guia **Compartilhado**.

Também pode encontrar todos os relatórios que criou na caixa **Pesquisar por nome** na parte superior da página ou editar e excluir clicando nos três pontos e escolhendo a opção adequada (editar detalhes de compartilhamento, excluir) ou ver quais filtros são aplicados em um relatório.

Os relatórios compartilhados sempre refletem o conjunto atual de permissões do criador (quais dados eles podem ver) e as configurações (o fuso horário e o início da semana no momento da criação).

Por exemplo, se você for um administrador e criar um link para o relatório onde poderá ver os valores faturáveis e todas as entradas de tempo, mas depois se tornar um usuário regular, o link para o relatório não


## Chunk 3

a o relatório onde poderá ver os valores faturáveis e todas as entradas de tempo, mas depois se tornar um usuário regular, o link para o relatório não funcionará porque você, como criador do o link não tem mais acesso a essa informação. Além disso, lembre-se de que os administradores podem ver todos os relatórios **público** compartilhados, mesmo que não sejam compartilhados diretamente com eles.

A página de relatórios compartilhados mostra os links que você criou pessoalmente e aqueles que outros usuários compartilharam com você. Além disso, você pode ver a lista de usuários com quem você pode compartilhar relatórios

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-20-at-15.22.58-1024x263.png)

Assim que um relatório compartilhado for excluído, o link ficará inativo e o navegador exibirá uma página em branco.

# Compreendendo estimativas, orçamentos e alertas de projetos Clockify


## Chunk 1

O Clockify oferece diversas maneiras de acompanhar o progresso e se manter informado por meio de estimativas de tempo, orçamento e alertas. Esses recursos funcionam de maneiras específicas, e aqui está uma análise completa.

As barras de progresso estimadas podem exceder 100% #
-----------------------------------------------------

Quando o tempo ou orçamento monitorado ultrapassa a estimativa, o Clockify não interrompe o monitoramento. Em vez disso, a barra de progresso do projeto ultrapassará 100% para refletir o excedente.

* 125% = 25% acima da estimativa
* Esse comportamento é intencional e ajuda a mensurar o quanto você excedeu

Orçamentos recorrentes são redefinidos automaticamente #
--------------------------------------------------------

Se você definiu uma estimativa recorrente semanal, mensal ou anual, o orçamento será zerado automaticamente ao final de cada ciclo, com base na data de início do projeto.

O que isso significa:

* Os orçamentos não desaparecem; eles apenas começam do zero para o novo período
* O status do projeto mostra apenas o progresso do ciclo atual

Como preservar dados históricos

Antes da data de reinicialização:

1. Ir para a página de Projetos
2. Clique em Exportar (CSV ou Excel)
3. A exportação inclui tempo rastreado, orçamento, estimativa, excedente, progresso e muito mais

Isso serve como um backup ou uma referência se você quiser comparar


## Chunk 2

inclui tempo rastreado, orçamento, estimativa, excedente, progresso e muito mais

Isso serve como um backup ou uma referência se você quiser comparar o desempenho entre períodos.

Os alertas podem não ser acionados se não forem configurados nesse limite  #
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Os alertas de estimativa são enviados apenas para limites explicitamente definidos.

Exemplo:

Se você definir um alerta apenas para 80% e não para 100%, não receberá nada quando a estimativa for totalmente atingida.

O que fazer:

Defina alertas em todos os limites relevantes (por exemplo, 50%, 80%, 100%) em Configurações do espaço de trabalho -> Alertas.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AD_4nXcAl0J6F2hD_ZNtHKSzzELsmdWwZ8D4eMFtvW14fSpQy0MbpljOI4wTB-uEjpHTWVP-octRdGEP9rAS3uDi3-DxOv7Jju03rtT0jA9QXYRpf1YPcMuqaKQR-HjrEoeZhC2rvUz4-g.png)

Alerts are not retroactive #
----------------------------

Se você criar ou editar uma regra de alerta depois que um limite já tiver sido ultrapassado, o Clockify não acionará o alerta retroativamente.

Clockify doesn’t block tracking beyond estimates #
----------------------------------------


## Chunk 3

assado, o Clockify não acionará o alerta retroativamente.

Clockify doesn’t block tracking beyond estimates #
--------------------------------------------------

Estimates are for informational purposes only. Clockify will not automatically prevent time tracking on those projects once an estimate or a budget is used up.

O que você pode fazer em vez disso:

* Configure alertas para notificar quando a estimativa estiver próxima ou for excedida
* Use a página de status do projeto para visualizar o status atual
* Crie diretrizes internas claras para interromper o trabalho manualmente

Método de controle opcional:

Once the project reaches its estimate or a budget limit, an Admin or a Project Manager can:

1. Ir para a página de Projetos
2. Clicar no projeto
3. Selecionar Arquivar

Isso impedirá que os membros da equipe dediquem tempo adicional ao projeto, o que efetivamente forçará uma paralisação gradual.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AD_4nXeqlZCb6UP67GKHZ1wlGh55_1j3htsQXc4hNYxpVdAR2ou10IOMISzso7286CIK0OxUxegsgFsRzj7wzYx6Dh5lEBgsrjHtVBgvXcvVX-HDlluH6KZbgkgpKrtFwTsTXsvH_dOa.png)

-------------------------------------------------

O Clockify permite que você acompanhe o progresso de um projeto usando dois tipos de estimativas: estimativas de tempo e estimativas de orçamento.

* Uma estimativa de tempo refe


## Chunk 4

acompanhe o progresso de um projeto usando dois tipos de estimativas: estimativas de tempo e estimativas de orçamento.

* Uma estimativa de tempo refere-se ao número de horas que você espera dedicar a um projeto. Ela se baseia puramente em registros de tempo monitorados e é ideal para gerenciar carga de trabalho, capacidade ou esforço interno.
* Uma estimativa de orçamento, por outro lado, refere-se ao valor monetário que você espera cobrar por um projeto. Depende da definição de valores por hora (remuneração de funcionários), seja no nível do projeto ou da tarefa.

As estimativas em nível de tarefa também oferecem suporte a alertas #
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Você pode atribuir estimativas e alertas a tarefas, não apenas a projetos completos.

Você pode notificar:

* Atribuídos da tarefa
* Gerente de Projeto
* Administrador do espaço de trabalho

Somente uma função pode ser selecionada por regra de alerta, mas você pode criar várias regras para notificar várias funções.

Os alertas de estimativa são enviados apenas uma vez por limite #
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Você receberá um alerta por limite (por exemplo, 80%, 100%). Se o progresso ultrapassar vários limites simultaneamente (por exemplo, de 75% para 95%), apenas o maior será acionado.

Um alerta para um limite só será acionado novamente s


## Chunk 5

ar vários limites simultaneamente (por exemplo, de 75% para 95%), apenas o maior será acionado.

Um alerta para um limite só será acionado novamente se o projeto ficar abaixo desse valor e, em seguida, ultrapassá-lo novamente.

# [ARTICLE] Compreendendo políticas de folgas e acúmulos Clockify
https://clockify.me/help/pt/troubleshooting/understanding-time-off/

# Compreendendo políticas de folgas e acúmulos Clockify


## Chunk 1

O Clockify permite que você gerencie as folgas dos funcionários com Políticas flexíveis de Folgas Feriados flexíveis. Este guia explica como tudo funciona, desde acúmulos e saldos até a estrutura e personalização das políticas.

Os pedidos de folga estão vinculados às políticas #
---------------------------------------------------

Para solicitar folga, um usuário deve estar vinculado a uma Política de Folga. Cada política define se:

* É necessária aprovação.
* Os lançamentos de tempo são criados automaticamente.
* Os acúmulos estão ativados.
* Saldos negativos são permitidos.
* O usuário pode tirar meio período.
* O tempo é medido em dias ou horas.

Como funcionam as aprovações #
------------------------------

As aprovações de folgas aplicam-se apenas às Políticas de Folgas, não às Políticas de Férias.

Você pode escolher se as solicitações de folgas precisam de aprovação:

* Se desabilitado, as solicitações de folga serão aprovadas automaticamente.
* Se habilitado, as solicitações deverão ser revisadas e aprovadas pelos usuários designados.

Quem pode aprovar solicitações de folga? #
------------------------------------------

Ao configurar uma Política de Folga, você terá três opções:

* Os administradores
  + Somente Administradores podem aprovar solicitações de folga
  + Administradores recebem notificações e visualizam todas as solicitações pendentes no ambiente de trab


## Chunk 2

tradores podem aprovar solicitações de folga
  + Administradores recebem notificações e visualizam todas as solicitações pendentes no ambiente de trabalho

* Gerentes de equipe
  + Somente os Gerentes de Equipe podem aprovar solicitações para os usuários que gerenciam
  + Administradores não serão notificados, a menos que também sejam designados como Gerentes de Equipe, mas ainda verão todas as solicitações

Se os Administradores também quiserem receber notificações, eles devem ser adicionados como Gerentes de Equipe aos usuários ou equipes relevantes.

* Membros específicos
  + Você pode selecionar membros específicos (de toda a sua equipe Clockify) para atuarem como aprovadores.
  + Os membros selecionados receberão notificações e poderão aprovar folgas.

Como funcionam os acúmulos #
----------------------------

Os acúmulos são opcionais e se aplicam apenas às Políticas de Folga, não às Políticas de Férias.

Se os acúmulos estiverem habilitados, você poderá definir quanto tempo de folga um usuário ganha ao longo do tempo.

Você pode optar por acumular:

* Por mês (ex.: 1,5 dia/mês)
* Por ano (ex.: 18 dias/ano)

Quando o tempo é adicionado?

* Monthly accruals are added on  the 1st of every month
* Os acréscimos anuais são adicionados no dia 1º de janeiro.

Posso acumular valores fracionários?

Sim, você não está limitado a dias inteiros. Você pode usar decimais como:

* 0,01


## Chunk 3

onados no dia 1º de janeiro.

Posso acumular valores fracionários?

Sim, você não está limitado a dias inteiros. Você pode usar decimais como:

* 0,01 dias por mês (para configurações granulares)
* 0,05, 1,25 ou qualquer valor personalizado que você precisar

Uma política se aplica a todos os integrantes #
-----------------------------------------------

Todos os usuários atribuídos à mesma política compartilharão as mesmas regras, incluindo:

* Taxa de acumulação
* Requisitos de aprovação
* Unidades de tempo permitidas (dias/horas)

Se você preferir que os membros da sua equipe tenham regras de acumulação diferentes, por exemplo:

* Um funcionário ganha 2 dias/ano
* Outro ganha 5 dias/ano

Considere criar políticas separadas para cada grupo ou indivíduo.

Folgas podem ser rastreadas em dias ou horas #
----------------------------------------------

Você pode escolher a unidade de tempo usada em cada política:

Isso também se aplica a acúmulos. Se você estiver usando uma política baseada em horas, poderá acumular horas por mês ou por ano, assim como os dias.

# Comprender las estimaciones, presupuestos y alertas del proyecto - Ayuda de Clockify


## Chunk 1

Clockify te ofrece múltiples maneras de seguir el progreso y mantenerte informado mediante estimaciones de tiempo, presupuesto y alertas. Estas características funcionan de forma específica, y aquí tienes un desglose completo.

Las barras de progreso de la estimación pueden superar el 100% #
----------------------------------------------------------------

Cuando el tiempo o el presupuesto rastreados superan la estimación, Clockify no detiene el seguimiento. En cambio, la barra de progreso del proyecto superará el 100% para reflejar el exceso.

* 125% = 25% por encima de la estimación
* Este comportamiento es intencional y te ayuda a medir cuánto has excedido

Los presupuestos recurrentes se restablecen automáticamente #
-------------------------------------------------------------

Si has establecido una estimación recurrente semanal, mensual o anual, el presupuesto se restablecerá automáticamente al final de cada ciclo según la fecha de inicio del proyecto.

Qué significa esto:

* Los presupuestos no desaparecen, simplemente empiezan de cero para el nuevo período
* El estado del proyecto solo muestra el progreso del ciclo actual

**Cómo conservar los datos históricos**

Antes de la fecha de reinicio:

1. Ve a la página de Proyectos
2. Haz clic en Exportar (CSV o Excel)
3. La exportación incluye el tiempo registrado, el presupuesto, la estimación, el exceso, el progreso y más

Es posible que las alertas no se activen si no se configuran en ese límite  #
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Las alertas de estimación solo se envían para los límites definidos explícitamente.

Por ejemplo:

Si configuras una alerta sólo al 80% y no al 100%, no recibirás nada cuando se alcance la estimación por completo.

Qué hacer:

Configura alertas en todos los límites relevantes (por ejemplo, 50%, 80%, 100%) en la Configuración del espacio de trabajo -> Alertas.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AD_4nXcAl0J6F2hD_ZNtHKSzzELsmdWwZ8D4eMFtvW14fSpQy0MbpljOI4wTB-uEjpHTWVP-octRdGEP9rAS3uDi3-DxOv7Jju03rtT0jA9QXYRpf1YPcMuqaKQR-HjrEoeZhC2rvUz4-g.png)

## Chunk 3

Si creas o editas una regla de alerta después de superar un límite, Clockify no la activará retroactivamente.

Clockify no bloquea el seguimiento posterior a las estimaciones #
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Las estimaciones son solo informativas. Clockify no impedirá automáticamente el control del tiempo en esos proyectos una vez que se agote una estimación o un presupuesto.

Qué puedes hacer en su lugar

* Configura alertas para notificar cuando la estimación esté cerca de alcanzarse o se supere
* Utiliza la página de estado del proyecto para ver el estado actual
* Crea directrices internas claras para detener el trabajo manualmente

Método de control opcional:

Una vez que el proyecto alcanza su estimación o un límite de presupuesto, como administrador o gerente de proyecto:

1. Ve a la página de Proyectos
2. Haz clic en el proyecto
3. Selecciona Archivar

Esto impedirá que los miembros del equipo registren tiempo adicional en ese proyecto, lo que impondrá una parada gradual.

## Chunk 4

empo vs. Estimación de presupuesto #
----------------------------------------------------

Clockify te permite seguir el progreso de un proyecto utilizando dos tipos de estimaciones: de tiempo y de presupuesto.

* Una estimación de tiempo se refiere a la cantidad de horas que esperas dedicar a un proyecto. Se basa exclusivamente en las entradas de tiempo rastreadas y es ideal para gestionar la carga de trabajo, la capacidad o el esfuerzo internos.
* Por otro lado, una estimación de presupuesto se refiere al valor monetario que esperas facturar por un proyecto. Depende de la configuración de tarifas por hora, ya sea a nivel de proyecto o de tarea.

Las estimaciones a nivel de tarea también admiten alertas #
-----------------------------------------------------------

Puedes asignar estimaciones y alertas a tareas, no solo a proyectos completos.

Puedes notificar a:

* Asignados a tareas
* Gerente de proyecto
* Administrador del espacio de trabajo

Solo se puede seleccionar un rol por regla de alerta, pero puedes crear varias reglas para notificar a varios roles.

Las alertas de estimación solo se envían una vez por límite #
-------------------------------------------------------------

* **Rapport hebdomadaire**Le rapport hebdomadaire est idéal pour le suivi hebdomadaire, car il affiche les saisies de temps regroupées par utilisateur ou par projet dans une plage hebdomadaire fixe.

4. **Montant total**
   Pour les heures facturables, le rapport affichera également la valeur monétaire totale basée sur le tarif défini pour chaque projet ou client.

FAQ #
-----

### Est-il possible de personnaliser la plage de dates pour les rapports ? #

Oui, vous pouvez personnaliser la plage de dates pour chaque rapport à l’aide de l’option **Calendrier** située en haut à droite de la page.

### Comment visualiser les heures facturables dans les rapports ? #

# Configurar seu espaço de trabalho Clockify


## Chunk 1

Como proprietário ou administrador de um espaço de trabalho, você pode configurar e gerenciar as configurações gerais.
Neste guia, mostraremos as etapas essenciais para ajustar, gerenciar usuários e personalizar as configurações para atender às necessidades da sua equipe.

O que é um espaço de trabalho? #
--------------------------------

Um espaço de trabalho é um conjunto de pessoas e projetos no Clockify. Ao se cadastrar no Clockify pela primeira vez, você receberá automaticamente um espaço de trabalho do Clockify e sua Conta CAKE.com com uma organização.
Você também pode ingressar em um espaço de trabalho do Clockify em uma organização CAKE.com existente. Um espaço de trabalho contém todos os registros de tempo, projetos, pessoas e configurações.

### Visibilidade #

Somente pessoas que fazem parte do espaço de trabalho podem visualizar e interagir com os seus dados. Você pode ser integrante de vários espaços de trabalhos simultaneamente e alternar entre eles facilmente.

### Múltiplos espaço de trabalhos  #

Com uma única conta Clockify, você pode criar ou ingressar em vários espaços de trabalho. Eles funcionam como entidades separadas, cada uma com seu próprio conjunto de usuários, projetos e entradas de tempo.

Múltiplos espaços de trabalho são úteis quando você deseja ter uma conta separada para cada sub empresa ou departamento. Isso é ideal se você precisar segregar o


## Chunk 2

paços de trabalho são úteis quando você deseja ter uma conta separada para cada sub empresa ou departamento. Isso é ideal se você precisar segregar o controle de tempo e os projetos entre várias equipes.

*Por exemplo, se você tiver duas empresas ou departamentos, poderá criar dois espaços de trabalho e convidar pessoas diferentes para cada um. Você pode então alternar entre eles conforme necessário.
Ou você pode ser um integrante da equipe em um espaço de trabalho e controlar o tempo para a empresa em que trabalha e ter um espaço de trabalho pessoal onde controlará seus projetos pessoais e será um administrador.*

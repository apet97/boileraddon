<p class="my-4 leading-7">If you are located in the European Economic Area (“<em><strong class="font-semibold">EEA</strong></em>”), the United Kingdom, or Switzerland, and you are an individual with a Developer Account whose personal information we control, you have certain rights and protections under the law regarding the processing of your personal information, and this section applies to you.</p>
<p class="my-4 leading-7"><em><strong class="font-semibold">Legal Basis for Processing</strong></em></p>
<p class="my-4 leading-7">When we process personal information, to the extent required by applicable law, we will do so in reliance on the following lawful bases:</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-5 my-4 leading-7">
<li class="[&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-2">To perform our responsibilities under our contract with you (e.g., processing payments for and providing the products and services you requested).</li>
<li class="[&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-2">When we have a legitimate interest in processing your personal information to operate our business or protect our interests (e.g., to provide, maintain, and improve our products and services, conduct data analytics, and communicate with you).</li>
<li class="[&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-2">To comply with our legal obligations (e.g., to maintain a record of your consents and track those who have opted out of marketing communications).</li>
<li class="[&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-2">When we have your consent to do so (e.g., when you opt in to receive marketing communications from us). When consent is the legal basis for our processing your personal information, you may withdraw such consent at any time.</li>
</ul>
<p class="my-4 leading-7"><em><strong class="font-semibold">Data Retention</strong></em></p>
<p class="my-4 leading-7">We store your personal information for as long as necessary to carry out the purposes for which we originally collected it and for other legitimate business purposes, including to meet our legal, regulatory, or other compliance obligations.</p>
<p class="my-4 leading-7"><em><strong class="font-semibold">Data Subject Requests</strong></em></p>
<p class="my-4 leading-7">To the extent required under applicable law, you have the right of:</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-5 my-4 leading-7">
<li class="[&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-2"><em><strong class="font-semibold">Access.</strong></em> You have the right to request a copy of the personal information we are processing about you, which we will provide to you in electronic form.</li>
<li class="[&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-2"><em><strong class="font-semibold">Rectification.</strong></em> You have the right to require that any incomplete or inaccurate personal information that we process about you is amended.</li>
<li class="[&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-2"><em><strong class="font-semibold">Deletion.</strong></em> You have the right to request that we delete personal information that we process about you, unless, for example, we are required to retain such data in order to comply with a legal obligation or to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</li>
<li class="[&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-2"><em><strong class="font-semibold">Restriction.</strong></em> You have the right to request that we restrict our processing of your personal information where: (i) you believe such data to be inaccurate; (ii) our processing is unlawful; or (iii) we no longer need to process such data for a particular purpose, but where we are not able to delete the data due to a legal or other obligation or because you do not want us to delete it.</li>
<li class="[&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-2"><em><strong class="font-semibold">Portability</strong></em>. You have the right to request that we transmit the personal information we hold with respect to you to another data controller.</li>
<li class="[&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-2"><em><strong class="font-semibold">Objection.</strong></em> Where the legal justification for our processing of your personal information is our legitimate interest, you have the right to object to such processing on grounds relating to your situation (e.g., direct marketing).  We will abide by your request unless we have compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests and rights, or if we need to continue to process the data for the establishment, exercise or defense of a legal claim.</li>
<li class="[&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-2"><em><strong class="font-semibold">Withdrawing Consent.</strong></em>  If you have consented to our processing of your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, free of charge. Please note that if you withdraw your consent, this will not affect the lawfulness of our use and processing of your information on the basis of your consent before the point in time when you withdraw your consent.</li>
</ul>

<p class="my-4 leading-7"><em><strong class="font-semibold">International data transfer</strong></em></p>
<p class="my-4 leading-7">We take steps to ensure that we handle your personal information subject to appropriate safeguards. As a US-based company, most of our operations are conducted in the United States and in order to provide the Sites, personal information will be processed in the United States, where laws regarding processing of personal information may be less stringent than the laws in your country. We provide appropriate protections for cross-border transfers as required by applicable law for international data transfers.  With respect to transfers originating from the European Economic Area, Switzerland or the UK, where applicable, the standard contractual clauses and the international data transfer addendum to the European Commission’s standard contractual clauses for international data transfers, approved by the European Commission and the UK Information Commissioner, respectively, are implemented. Where required by such laws, you may request a copy of the suitable mechanisms we have in place by contacting us as detailed below.</p>
<p class="my-4 leading-7">In some cases, we may provide you with the option to choose the location, including locations in the EEA, in which we store and process your data.  To the extent we provide that option to you, we will only process and store your data in the designated location and not transfer your data outside that jurisdiction, except in accordance with applicable law.</p>
<p class="my-4 leading-7"><em><strong class="font-semibold">Questions or Complaints</strong></em></p>

<p class="my-4 leading-7">We want to make sure that every individual using any CAKE.com Marketplace add-on gets a product that is useful, has high performance and uses their data responsibly.
That’s why we’ve compiled a set of instructions and guidelines that can help you build the add-on that meets these standards. Prior to building, please, take a couple of minutes and read through these to make sure that the add-on you want to build complies with the requirements listed below.</p>

<p class="my-4 leading-7"><em><strong class="font-semibold">Become familiar with the system.</strong></em></p>
<p class="my-4 leading-7">Clockify is a complex system consisting of many components with all sorts of dependencies between them: Timesheet, Timetracker, Calendar, Report, Project, etc. They all work together and complement each other perfectly. That’s why, it’s important you’re familiar with all the entities and patterns that Clockify comprises, so that you can use them in a way that Clockify’s customers are familiar with.</p>
<p class="my-4 leading-7">To better understand elements used to build Clockify, check out Clockify’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://clockify.me/help/getting-started/clockify_basics/clockify-glossary" class="link_03735  link_3b154 inline-link_3b154">Glossary of terms</a>.</p>
<p class="my-4 leading-7"><em><strong class="font-semibold">Strive to enhance customer experience.</strong></em></p>
<p class="my-4 leading-7">If you’re already our customer, you can start building an app that will benefit you and your team, solve your problems and later share it with everyone else.
If you’ve never used our product, we recommend you create <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://app.clockify.me/en/login" class="link_03735  link_3b154 inline-link_3b154">a free account</a>. Try to build something new and unique.</p>
<p class="my-4 leading-7"><em><strong class="font-semibold">Be clear about the purpose.</strong></em></p>
<p class="my-4 leading-7">Sharing data with a third party can be scary for some users. Therefore, you should be clear on how what you built adds value to their customer experience and state clearly what their data will (and won’t) be used for.</p>
<p class="my-4 leading-7"><em><strong class="font-semibold">Don’t mislead your users.</strong></em></p>
<p class="my-4 leading-7">Make sure you clearly stated add-on’s purpose and necessary details when creating your first version. You should also provide clear descriptions, screenshots and videos in order to describe your add-on accurately.</p>
<p class="my-4 leading-7"><em><strong class="font-semibold">Explore our branding guidelines.</strong></em></p>
<p class="my-4 leading-7">Since an add-on you’re building will be part of an existing product, we suggest you take a look at our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.figma.com/@cake_dot_com" class="link_03735  link_3b154 inline-link_3b154">product branding guidelines</a> and check if the assets you built follow these guidelines before you submit an add-on for a review.</p>
<p class="my-4 leading-7"><em><strong class="font-semibold">Make an easy setup.</strong></em></p>
<p class="my-4 leading-7">More people are likely to use an add-on that’s easy to set up. This is one of the crucial characteristics that attracts new users.
For instance, if using your product requires an account, it should be created by getting the credentials from Clockify. If you need to ask customers to sign up manually, you should pre-fill some user information, e.g. user email.</p>
<p class="my-4 leading-7"><em><strong class="font-semibold">Inform user of a third-party account.</strong></em></p>
<p class="my-4 leading-7">If, in order to use add-on, user needs to create a separate third-party account (i.e. log in to another service), this must be stated clearly to the user in the description and the overview of the add-on.</p>
<p class="my-4 leading-7"><em><strong class="font-semibold">Check grammar and spelling.</strong></em></p>
<p class="my-4 leading-7">Add-on should not contain any typos, or grammatical errors. Therefore, check grammar and spelling prior to submitting it for a review.</p>

<p class="my-4 leading-7">To ensure that CAKE.com Marketplace is a safe platform, we’ve created standards that define and prohibit content that is harmful, inappropriate or offensive to others.</p>
<p class="my-4 leading-7"><em><strong class="font-semibold">Hate speech.</strong></em></p>
<p class="my-4 leading-7">Add-ons that promote violence, or incite hatred against individuals, or a group of individuals based on race, ethnicity, religion, age, disability, nationality, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or any other characteristic associated with discrimination will not be published.</p>
<p class="my-4 leading-7"><em><strong class="font-semibold">Violence.</strong></em></p>
<p class="my-4 leading-7">We don’t allow add-ons that facilitate or promote violence or endangerment of an individual’s safety.</p>
<p class="my-4 leading-7"><em><strong class="font-semibold">Bullying and harassment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="my-4 leading-7">Add-ons that contain or encourage threats, harassment and bullying will not be published.</p>
<p class="my-4 leading-7"><em><strong class="font-semibold">Harmful and malicious products.</strong></em></p>
<p class="my-4 leading-7">Add-ons that promote or support any type of harmful and malicious products won’t be published.</p>

<p class="my-4 leading-7">Keep in mind that assets that contain any type of prohibited content will not be published. Also, any prohibited, or harmful content that is added after reviewing and publishing, and reported by users, will be removed from the marketplace immediately.

<p class="my-4 leading-7">You’ll have complete independence and autonomy over building your add-on. This means that you’ll build it locally, but before submitting your code for a review, you should test it in the testing environment provided to you. Also, check out our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.developer.clockify.me/" class="link_03735  link_3b154 inline-link_3b154">REST API documentation</a> and Development Toolkit section to get a better insight on how to build and maintain add-ons. Add-on then needs to be approved by our developers in the reviewing process and then it can be published.<br>
To make sure the whole process goes smoothly and your request is approved shortly, we will provide you with the necessary requirements and standards all CAKE.com add-ons should meet in order to be published.</p>

<p class="my-4 leading-7">Every created add-on must have a version. Versioning add-ons helps you create and improve add-on’s functionality easily and gradually without causing inconvenience to your users.</p>
<p class="my-4 leading-7">In order to create a new version, at least one version of an add-on needs to be published. Learn more about how to create add-on’s first version on Create Add-on section above.</p>
<p class="my-4 leading-7">First version will be automatically created as version 1.0.0. For each new request, you need to manually add the version number. Version number should reflect complexity of the functionalities with major version being marked as e.g. 1.1.0 and minor version as e.g. 1.0.1. Also, keep in mind that version numbers should be marked in a logical progression, e.g. 2.0.0 version cannot be followed by version 1.5.0.</p>
<p class="my-4 leading-7">Creating new version is a three-step process similar to the one used to create an add-on.
However, when creating new version, add-on name and icon in the Basic information page are generated from the published version, but can be edited. Steps two and three are the same.</p>

<p class="my-4 leading-7">Based on its lifecycle stage, status of add-on’s version request can be:</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-5 my-4 leading-7">
<li class="[&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-2">Draft</li>
</ul>
<p class="my-4 leading-7">Version request is in draft if you haven’t completed all the steps when creating an add-on, but you saved information you entered by clicking the Save as draft button.</p>

<ul class="list-disc pl-5 my-4 leading-7">
<li class="[&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-2">Declined</li>
</ul>
<p class="my-4 leading-7">After your version is reviewed, it can be approved or declined. If your version is declined, along with that information, you will also get an explanation on why. You can edit the declined version based on this feedback and submit it for a review again.</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-5 my-4 leading-7">
<li class="[&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-2">Approved</li>

<li class="[&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-2">Published</li>
</ul>
<p class="my-4 leading-7">This is the final step in the publishing cycle. Once the version is approved, it can be published and when published it becomes available in the marketplace for everyone to use.
After you published one add-on version, you can proceed by creating a new one.</p>
<p class="my-4 leading-7">Once your add-on (first, or any subsequent version) has been published on the CAKE.com Marketplace, you’ll receive a confirmation email saying that your add-on version has been successfully published.</p>

<p class="my-4 leading-7">After you’ve sent the request to delete an add-on, our support team will contact you shortly, and ask for confirmation. Soon after your confirmation, the process of deletion will start. Add-on users will receive an email that informs them of deletion and you will receive an email that notifies you that the process has begun.</p>
<p class="my-4 leading-7">Once the process has started, add-on is unlisted, removed from the marketplace and unavailable for new users. The existing users will be able to use the add-on until it is deleted. To ensure that they are informed, after the deletion process is set in motion, information of the deletion and add-on’s retirement date will be prominently displayed at the top of the page throughout the application.</p>

<p class="my-4 leading-7">As you’ll have access to customer information which includes personal data, it’s important how you store and handle the data. Personal data is sensitive and in many cases regulated by applicable laws. Listed below are best practices you should follow, in addition to the <a class="link_03735  link_3b154 inline-link_3b154 cursor-pointer" target="" href="/terms.html">Terms of Use</a>, when developing the add-on on the CAKE.com marketplace.</p>
<h3 id="clearly-explain-your-data-privacy-practices" class="mt-10 mb-2 leading-7 text-xl title_3b154">Clearly explain your data privacy practices<a class="link_3b154 header-anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#clearly-explain-your-data-privacy-practices">#</a></h3>
<p class="my-4 leading-7">When submitting your add-on for review you are required to provide a Privacy policy which should explain to the users how you plan on using their data. The privacy policy should clearly explain to the user what data the add-on will collect, how that data will be used, who will have access to the data and explain the user’s choice.</p>
<h3 id="minimize-the-data-you-collect" class="mt-10 mb-2 leading-7 text-xl title_3b154">Minimize the data you collect<a class="link_3b154 header-anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#minimize-the-data-you-collect">#</a></h3>
<p class="my-4 leading-7">Collect data only where you need it. Do not collect the data because you think it may be useful later. Where personal data is involved, consider de-identifying it. Also consider deleting user data when they request it or when they uninstall your add-on. Have in mind that you don’t need to store data indefinitely, put some data retention schemes in place.</p>
<h3 id="get-consent-for-certain-data-use" class="mt-10 mb-2 leading-7 text-xl title_3b154">Get consent for certain data use<a class="link_3b154 header-anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#get-consent-for-certain-data-use">#</a></h3>
<p class="my-4 leading-7">When submitting an add-on for review you’ll have to check which data you collect in the permissions tab. You should only collect the data you checked in that tab. In this way users consent to the usage of their data when installing an add-on, but only for the purpose of an add-on. Using data for marketing, sharing data with third-parties and other data use cases not strictly required to support the operation of your add-on may require a separate consent from the user before collecting or using the data. As a general rule of thumb, you should always get consent if the user would not expect their data to be used or shared in a particular way given the purpose of your add-on.</p>
<p class="my-4 leading-7">Consent may not be embedded in a privacy policy. Instead, it must be collected from the user directly. You are responsible for collecting and maintaining all such consents, either through the add-on itself or through direct communication with the add-on user.</p>
<p class="my-4 leading-7">Note, regardless of whether you obtain consent, some data use cases may be prohibited by the <a class="link_03735  link_3b154 inline-link_3b154 cursor-pointer" target="" href="/terms.html">Terms of Use</a>. You are responsible for reviewing and complying with those terms.</p>

<p class="my-4 leading-7">Applicable laws and data management best practices require that you make it easy for users to get a copy of, correct and delete their personal data. This means, if you are storing personal data, you need to know where that personal data is at all times and be able to update it or remove it upon request.</p>
<h3 id="offer-additional-data-processing-terms" class="mt-10 mb-2 leading-7 text-xl title_3b154">Offer additional data processing terms<a class="link_3b154 header-anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#offer-additional-data-processing-terms">#</a></h3>
<p class="my-4 leading-7">If you are accessing, storing or otherwise processing personal data of EEA residents, users may request that you sign and comply with additional data protection terms, consistent with Article 28 of the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). You are responsible for understanding and complying with the terms required under Article 28 of the GDPR as it relates to the user data you access, store or otherwise process in connection with the user’s consent to install and share data with your add-on.</p>

<p class="my-4 leading-7">You must take reasonable steps to protect user data shared with you and collected by your add-on, including user device information. We recommend you to follow our Security guidelines for a more comprehensive list for securing your add-on.</p>
<p class="my-4 leading-7">In the event your add-on or suppliers experience a data security breach, you are responsible for communicating with users and regulators, as required by applicable law. It’s also important to let us know of the incident by emailing to <a href="mailto:support@cake.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link_03735  link_3b154 inline-link_3b154">support@cake.com</a>.</p>

# CAKE.com Marketplace Listing Agreement[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/cake-com-marketplace-listing-agreement.html)

***Last Updated***: 21/02/2023

This CAKE.com Marketplace Listing Agreement (this “***Agreement***”) is a binding agreement between CAKE.com Inc. (“***CAKE.com***”, “***we***” or “***us***”) and the individual or entity submitting an Add-On in the CAKE.com Marketplace (“***Developer***” or “***you***”). Your access to and use of the CAKE.com Marketplace, including your submission and listing of an Add-On, is governed by this Agreement and the CAKE.com [Developer Terms](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/terms.html) (“Developer Terms”), which together form an agreement between you and CAKE.com.

***By checking the box (or similar action) to accept this Agreement or by submitting any Add-On to the CAKE.com Marketplace, you agree to be bound by this Agreement.***

***By using the CAKE.com Marketplace, you affirm that you are of legal age to enter into this Agreement.***

***If you are an individual accessing or using the site on behalf of, or for the benefit of, any corporation, partnership or other entity with which you are associated (an “Organization”), then you are agreeing to this agreement on behalf of yourself and such Organization, and you represent and warrant that you have the legal authority to bind such Organization to this agreement. References to “you” and “your” in this agreement will refer to both the individual using the site and to any such Organization.***

Under this Agreement, you appoint and authorize CAKE.com, as your commercial agent, to promote, sell, test and distribute Add-Ons (as defined below) on the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and CAKE.com accepts such appointment.

We may change this Agreement from time to time by notifying you of such changes by any reasonable means, including by posting a revised Agreement through our website. Any such changes will not apply to any dispute between you and us arising prior to the date on which we posted the revised Agreement incorporating such changes, or otherwise notified you of such changes. Your use of the Developer Portal or the CAKE.com Marketplace following any changes to this Agreement will constitute your acceptance of such changes. The “Last Updated” legend above indicates when this Agreement was last changed.

***1. Introduction to the CAKE.com Marketplace***

The CAKE.com marketplace is an application-based marketplace that allows participating developers to offer Add-Ons for Services to CAKE.com’s Enterprise Users pursuant to each developer’s terms and conditions. Add-Ons can be written using the CAKE.com Tools and can be written for use with certain CAKE.com products. As a Marketplace participant, you may charge a fee for your Add-Ons or offer your Add-Ons free of charge under certain circumstances.

***2. Key Definitions***

All capitalized terms that are not defined herein have the meanings ascribed to them in the Developer Terms.

***2.1. “Add-On User Data”*** means any data, content or information of an Add-On User, including personal information, that is accessed, collected, stored, or otherwise processed by you or your Add-On in connection with its use with the CAKE.com Marketplace or Services.

***2.2. “Add-On User Privacy Policy”*** means a legally adequate and compliant privacy policy provided to each Add-On User from whom you or your Add-On collects, accesses, or otherwise processes Add-On User Data.

***2.3. “Add-On User Terms”*** means a legally adequate and compliant agreement governing Add-On Users’ use of your Add-Ons.

***2.4. “Marketplace Guidelines”*** means the terms, rules and policies that CAKE.com makes available at dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com, which set forth certain requirements (as may be modified by CAKE.com from time to time) for offering your Add-Ons in the CAKE.com Marketplace.

***2.5. “Net Revenues”*** means all gross revenues received by CAKE.com from Sales, less (a) applicable taxes, (b) sales processing, and (c) returns, rebates, charge-backs, fraudulent transaction amounts, and refunds. “Applicable taxes” do not include withholding taxes, which are addressed in Section 4.6(b).

***2.6. “New Versions”*** means any enhancements, upgrades, updates, bug fixes, patches, new versions and other modifications and amendments to your Add-Ons.

***2.7. “Process”***, ***“Processing”***, and/or ***“Processed”*** means any operation or set of operations that are performed on personal information or on sets of personal information, whether or not by automated means.

***2.8. “Security Incident”*** means any actual or suspected (a) unauthorized access, acquisition, use, disclosure, modification, loss or destruction of Add-On User Data in the possession or control of you or your agents or contractors (whether intentional or accidental), (b) security vulnerability or compromise of your Add-On or (c) issue involving your Add-On that materially degrades CAKE.com systems or networks.

***2.9. “Developer Portal”*** means the online platform made accessible to Developer by CAKE.com, available at [developer.marketplace.cake.com](https://developer.marketplace.cake.com), on which CAKE.com from time to time will communicate program details and changes and provide sales tools and services to Developer.

***3. Using the Marketplace to Publish Your Add-Ons***

Subject to successful completion of CAKE.com’s review process, you may offer Add-Ons in the CAKE.com Marketplace. You designate your listing type using your Developer Account on the CAKE.com Marketplace (subject to approval by CAKE.com), based on the following options: (a) Add-Ons that you provide free of charge (“Free Add-Ons”) and (b) Add-Ons for which Add-On Users pay all fees to CAKE.com (with Developer receiving a Revenue Share as described in this Agreement, and CAKE.com receiving the Revenue Share from Add-On Users as Developer’s commercial agent) (“Paid Add-Ons”).

***4. Financial Terms***

This Section 4 (Financial Terms) shall only apply to Paid Add-Ons.

***4.1. List Price.*** Subject to the remainder of this Section 4 and the other terms of this Agreement, you have discretion to set the commercial pricing tiers for initial sales, licenses or subscriptions to your Paid Add-Ons (the “List Prices”). “Sale” includes any initial or renewal sale, subscription or license of a Paid Add-On (or related content or services) through the CAKE.com Marketplace.

Paid Add-Ons shall be initially installed and paid per Workspace on a monthly basis, and gradually Add-Ons shall be installed and paid either per Workspace or per Seat on a monthly basis.

***4.2. Fee.*** As consideration for the services rendered by CAKE.com (including through its contractors) under this Agreement, CAKE.com may retain a share of Net Revenues as specified in the Developer Portal, namely, CAKE.com through the Marketplace as a platform for Add-On Sale shall retain 15% of the Net Revenues as a percentage of each Add-On Sale (“Platform Fee”). CAKE.com shall remit to Developer the remaining portion of Net Revenues (“Developer Revenue”) in accordance with this Section 4. CAKE.com may, in its sole discretion, issue refunds or return any amounts paid to Add-On Users in accordance with CAKE.com’s standard procedures and policies.

***4.3. Currency Conversion.*** Unless otherwise specified in the Marketplace Guidelines, you will designate your List Price in United States Dollars (USD), as a default currency, through the Developer Portal and CAKE.com will make all Developer Revenue payments to you in Developer Currency.

All Developer Revenues shall be exchanged to the currency which is designated based on the country you selected on the Developer Portal (“Developer Currency”). Developer Revenue decreased for the amount of Platform Fee shall be exchanged into Developer Currency based on the official exchange rate of the European Central Bank on the day the User purchased the Paid Add-On (“Total Balance”).

***4.4. Payment by CAKE.com.*** CAKE.com shall remit Developer Revenue to Developer on a monthly basis at latest within nine (9) days after the beginning of each month for the current month (each, a “Payment”), together with a report showing the calculation of Developer Revenue. Developer shall be solely responsible for any and all financial institution fees relating to each Payment.

CAKE.com will not be required to remit Developer Revenue for any month in which Developer Revenue is less than Two Hundred and Fifty U.S. Dollars (USD $250) (or the equivalent amount in other Developer Currency, based on CAKE.com’s standard currency exchange process and timing) (the “Threshold”); provided that, any such amounts that do not meet the Threshold (each a “Withheld Amount”) will be carried forward month-over-month until the sum of such Withheld Amounts exceeds the Threshold, at which time CAKE.com will make a Payment for such Withheld Amounts to Developer within thirty (30) days after the end of the month in which the Threshold is met.

For each Payment, certain time period has to lapse in order for Developer to be eligible for Payment (“Holding Period”). Developer will be eligible for Payment when Holding Period has lapsed once the Threshold is met (Holding Period might vary from 61 days to 95 days). Holding Period determination shall depend on the payer’s bank policy.

First Payment shall be made by CAKE.com once the Threshold is met and when Holding Period has lapsed.

***4.5. Use of Certain Information.*** CAKE.com may use or disclose aggregated sales and other financial data related to the CAKE.com Marketplace, which may include your sales and related financial data but does not identify you or your data specifically.

***4.6. Taxes.***

***(a) Sales Taxes.*** In the event that CAKE.com’s sale or delivery of any Add-On to any Add-On User is subject to any sales, use, goods and services, value added, or other similar tax (other than Developer’s income taxes) under Applicable Laws (collectively, “Sales Taxes”), responsibility for the collection and remittance of such Sales Taxes will be determined by CAKE.com and remitted by CAKE.com to relevant tax or other competent authorities. Developer shall indemnify and hold CAKE.com harmless against any and all claims by any tax or other competent authority for any underpayment of any Sales Taxes, and any penalties and/or interest thereon.

***(b) Withholding Taxes.*** In the event that any remittance or Payment made by CAKE.com to Developer is subject to any withholding or similar tax (“Withholding Tax”), the full amount of such Withholding Tax shall be solely from Developer’s Account and will not reduce the amount to which CAKE.com is entitled. If CAKE.com reasonably believes that Withholding Tax is due, CAKE.com may deduct the full amount of such Withholding Tax from the amount otherwise owed to Developer and may pay the full amount withheld over to the relevant tax or other competent authority. Where applicable, CAKE.com will apply a reduced rate of Withholding Tax, if any, provided for in any applicable income tax treaty only if Developer furnishes CAKE.com with the documentation required under such income tax treaty, or documentation otherwise satisfactory to CAKE.com, sufficient to establish Developer’s entitlement to the benefit of such reduced rate of Withholding Tax. Upon Developer’s timely request to CAKE.com in writing, using means reasonably designated by CAKE.com, CAKE.com will use commercially practical efforts to report to Developer the amount of CAKE.com’s payment of Withholding Tax to the relevant tax or other competent authority on Developer’s behalf. Developer will indemnify and hold harmless CAKE.com against any and all claims by any tax or other competent authority for any underpayment of any Withholding Tax, and any penalties and/or interest thereon including underpayment attributable to any erroneous claim or representation by Developer as to Developer’s entitlement to the benefit of a reduced rate of, or Developer’s disqualification from, Withholding Tax.

Together with delivery of each Add-On, you will also provide the following information and materials: (a) Add-On title, category, Developer name, List Prices (if applicable), product description, icon, logo or banner images, security and privacy information, and any other information related to the Add-Ons that CAKE.com requires; (b) the metadata, graphics, artwork, images, trademarks, trade names, logos and other descriptive or identifying information and materials associated with you or a particular Add-On that you wish to appear in connection with your Add-On; and (c) your Add-On User Terms (if any) and Add-On User Privacy Policy ((a)-(c), collectively, “Product Information”).

***(f) Security.*** You must implement, maintain, and monitor a comprehensive written information security policy that contains appropriate administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Add-On User Data and prevent any unauthorized or unlawful Processing of such data. The safeguards will be appropriate to the nature of the Add-On User Data, meet or exceed prevailing industry standards, and comply with Applicable Laws. You will also comply with any security, coding practices, authentication, encryption, or other requirements for Add-Ons set forth in the Marketplace Guidelines or otherwise made available to you in the Developer Portal. You agree to remediate all security vulnerabilities identified to you by CAKE.com within the timeframes described in the Security Requirements.

***(g) Security Incidents.*** Upon discovery or notice of any Security Incident, unless prohibited by Applicable Laws, you will promptly (within 24 hours) notify CAKE.com via email at [support@cake.com](mailto:support@cake.com).

However, you must obtain CAKE.com’s approval for any breach notifications to Add-On Users to the extent they refer directly or indirectly to CAKE.com. You must ensure that you have an updated contact name and contact information in your Developer Account for Security Incidents. Without limiting any other reserved rights of termination or suspension, CAKE.com may de-list your Add-On from the CAKE.com Marketplace or suspend use of or access of your Add-On to CAKE.com products as a result of any Security Incident.

***(h) Security and Privacy Review.*** CAKE.com, or an authorized third party selected by us, may conduct a security or privacy review of any Add-On or its supporting infrastructure to ensure compliance with (i) your obligations under Section 8.3 or (ii) security and privacy related sections of the Marketplace Guidelines. Security and privacy reviews may include, without limitation: information requests to you, reviews of your documentation, interviews, security testing, technical testing and reviews, code reviews and scans (which may reverse engineer binary code), event logging, network testing, and vulnerability threat assessments.

CAKE.com (itself or through third parties) may conduct new or additional Add-On security scans beyond those described in this Section 8.3(h), in which case CAKE.com will provide you at least 15 days prior notice, and you may choose to object to such scan with notice to CAKE.com.

CAKE.com may stop any transaction, or take other actions as needed to restrict access to or availability of any Content that does not comply with this Agreement or that otherwise might adversely affect Enterprise Users or Add-On Users. For the avoidance of doubt and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, CAKE.com shall have the right to suspend or remove any Add-On that does not function properly, does not comply with this Agreement, or does not comply with Applicable Laws.

***(a) Pending Orders; Transition Period.*** Following any termination or expiration of this Agreement or withdrawal of your Add-On from the Marketplace, (i) in CAKE.com’s discretion, CAKE.com may continue to fulfill any Add-On orders for Add-Ons pending as of the date the termination takes effect, and (ii) CAKE.com will use reasonable efforts to take down the listing for your Add-On within forty-five (45) days after the effective date of termination (or, if specified by CAKE.com, within the same period after notice of termination) (the “Transition Period”). Unless CAKE.com specifies in writing otherwise, you must continue to make Add-Ons available during the Transition Period and shall not delete your Developer Account during this time period. CAKE.com may also retain copies of your Content after termination or expiration of this Agreement, or withdrawal of your Add-On, to the extent necessary for its own record-keeping purposes or to comply with Applicable Laws.

***(b) Add-On User Rights.*** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated herein, you are responsible for terminating your Add-On with your Add-On Users in accordance with your Add-On Terms. The termination provisions in your Add-On Terms must allow your Add-On to properly terminate once CAKE.com no longer offers your Add-Ons in the Marketplace in accordance with these Terms. You understand and agree that upon termination of these Terms and any applicable Transition Period, CAKE.com will not offer or support your Add-On, and CAKE.com is in no way responsible for any issues relating to your termination of or failure to terminate Add-Ons with Add-On Users.

***(c) Your Transition Obligations.*** Prior to expiration of the Transition Period (and otherwise in a timely manner) you are responsible for, consistent with CAKE.com’s guidance and instructions, notifying Add-On Users that the Add-On will become unavailable in a manner that complies with Applicable Laws and, at minimum, includes the date on which it will become unavailable.

For the sake of clarity, after termination, you are not obligated to provide any New Versions of your terminated Add-On to CAKE.com for distribution under this Agreement thereafter, but CAKE.com’s post-termination rights in this Section 10.3 will apply for the latest version of the Add-On you provided to CAKE.com hereunder.

***10.4. Survival.*** The following sections of this Agreement will survive termination or expiration of this Agreement and any Transition Period: Sections 4 (Financial Terms), 5.2 (Accuracy), 8 (Additional CAKE.com Marketplace Terms) (excluding your participation in any Add-On Program or use of related badges), and 9 (CAKE.com Control of Marketplace) through 18 (General).

# Authentication & authorization[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html)

## Basics[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html)

In order to build add-ons for the Clockify app, CAKE.com Marketplace API needs to interact with the [Clockify API](https://docs.clockify.me/).
For an add-on to have access to the Clockify API, every request needs to have an `X-Addon-Token` header with a valid add-on token.

Tokens and API keys that are provided to add-ons by Clockify are collectively called `add-on tokens`.
Your add-on tokens along with your API keys should be kept secret.
There are several types of add-on tokens that an add-on can receive, depending on the context. Each specific token type has its own use cases, as described below.

### Rate limits[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html)

Requests to the Clockify API are rate limited. Please note that the limit is subject to change in the future.
You can read more about rate limits on the [Clockify documentation](https://docs.clockify.me/).

> If the limit is exceeded, a ‘Too many requests’ error will be returned.

## Tokens[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html)

### Installation token[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html)

The installation token is supplied as part of the installation payload if the add-on has defined an `installed` lifecycle in its [manifest](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/index.html).
For more information about lifecycle requests sent to add-ons, check out the [add-on lifecycle](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/index.html) section.

This token is unique and is specific for each add-on installation on a given workspace. Each time an add-on gets reinstalled a new payload will be provided.
You can obtain this token by reading `authToken` property of `installed` lifecycle hook payload.
This token has admin privileges in the workspace and does not expire.

> You **must** ensure the token value is kept a secret and is not leaked externally as it has full access over the workspace.

> If the add-on is uninstalled from the workspace, the installation token will no longer be valid.

***Example usages***

Installation tokens are intended to be used by the add-on's backend.
They can be used in cases where full access over the workspace is required, long-running operations, reporting etc.
Installation tokens can also be exchanged for [user tokens](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html) for fine-grained access over a specific user.

***Exchanging for a user token***

There may be cases where you might want to use a [user token](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html) rather than an installation token, for instance when interacting with a user's profile.

To do so, Clockify exposes the following endpoint:

```
1Request Headers:
2Content-Type: application/json
3X-Addon-Token: {installation token}
4
5Request Endpoint:
6POST {backendUrl}/addon/user/{userId}/token
```

The response body will be a string which will be the user token for the user specified by the ID.
The generated user token will work the same way as the [user tokens](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html) that are supplied to iframes.

### User token[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html)

The user token is supplied as a query parameter whenever a UI component or a custom settings UI is loaded into Clockify.
UI components are loaded and rendered inside an iframe and the loaded URL will always contain a query parameter named `auth_token`.
This token is unique to each user of the add-on on a given workspace.

The user token acts on behalf of a single user, the user that is currently viewing the UI component, and has a lifespan of 30 minutes.
After a token expires, a new one can be requested by dispatching the [appropriate window event](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/window-events.html).

> As the token acts on behalf of a workspace user, it will have the same access and permissions as the user does.

Differently from the installation token, the user token will also contain claims pertaining to the user such as role, language, theme etc.

***Example usages***

User tokens can be used on both the add-on frontend and the add-on backend.

On the frontend, through UI components, it can be used to interact and make requests to the Clockify API.
All requests made to the Clockify API will be on behalf of the current user and will share the same rate-limiting quota.

On the backend, the user token can either be retrieved through the frontend or it can be retrieved by exchanging the [installation token](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html) for a user token.

### Webhook signature[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html)

A webhook signature is a type of token that is provided as a signature to verify the authenticity of webhook requests.

Unlike the installation or user tokens, it cannot be used to authenticate and interact with the Clockify API. Its purpose is strictly to be used for request verification.

This token contains a reduced set of claims which can be used to identify the workspace and the add-on installation for which the event was triggered.
Some of the available claims for this type of token are:

`sub
workspaceId
addonId`

You can read more about the above claims on the section [below](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html).

## Claims[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html)

To provide more context on the [environment](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/environments-and-regions.html) where the add-on has been installed, both the `installation` and `user` tokens will contain a set of claims that can be used to determine the location of the Clockify API endpoints or retrieve more information about the installation.

The following set of claims is present in both `installation` and `user` token types:

`"backendUrl": "https://api.clockify.me/api",
"reportsUrl": "https://reports.api.clockify.me",
"locationsUrl": "https://locations.api.clockify.me",
"screenshotsUrl": "https://screenshots.api.clockify.me",
"sub": "{add-on key}",
"workspaceId": "{workspace id}",
"user": "{user id}",
"addonId": "{add-on id}",`

* URL claims - the location of the API endpoints for the environment where the add-on is installed
* sub - the sub field will be the same as the key that is defined in the add-on manifest. The sub is used to verify that the token is signed on behalf of your add-on.
* workspaceId - the ID of the workspace where the add-on is installed
* user - the ID of the workspace owner (for installation tokens), or the ID of the user who is currently logged in and viewing a UI component (for user tokens)
* addonId - the ID of the add-on installation on the workspace

The following set of claims is present only in the `user` token type:

`"language": "EN",
"theme": "DEFAULT",
"workspaceRole": "OWNER",`

* language - the [language settings](https://clockify.me/help/administration/profile-settings) for the current user. You may use this to support multiple languages and localized content for you add-on.
* theme - the [theme settings](https://clockify.me/help/administration/profile-settings) for the current user. It is strongly recommended that your add-on uses the same theme colors the user has configured on Clockify.
* workspaceRole - the role of the current user on this workspace. Learn more about roles on the Clockify API [docs](https://docs.clockify.me/)

## Token verification[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html)

All tokens signed by Clockify are [JWT](https://jwt.io/) tokens which are signed with the RSA256 algorithm

Tokens that Clockify may sign include:

* [installation token](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html)
* [user token](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html)
* [webhook signature](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html)
* lifecycle signature

The following is a checklist of the steps that need to be taken to verify that an add-on token is valid:

1. Verify signature

Before accepting the token or any of its claims as valid, the signature should first be verified.
To verify the token's signature, you have to use the following X509 public key which is provided below in PEM format:

`-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAubktufFNO/op+E5WBWL6
/Y9QRZGSGGCsV00FmPRl5A0mSfQu3yq2Yaq47IlN0zgFy9IUG8/JJfwiehsmbrKa
49t/xSkpG1u9w1GUyY0g4eKDUwofHKAt3IPw0St4qsWLK9mO+koUo56CGQOEpTui
5bMfmefVBBfShXTaZOtXPB349FdzSuYlU/5o3L12zVWMutNhiJCKyGfsuu2uXa9+
6uQnZBw1wO3/QEci7i4TbC+ZXqW1rCcbogSMORqHAP6qSAcTFRmrjFAEsOWiUUhZ
rLDg2QJ8VTDghFnUhYklNTJlGgfo80qEWe1NLIwvZj0h3bWRfrqZHsD/Yjh0duk6
yQIDAQAB
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----`

2. Verify token expiration

The token expiration should be checked and expired tokens should be rejected.

3. Verify token claims

The following claims must always match these values to verify that the token is being used for its intended purpose:

`iss=clockify
type=addon`

The `iss` claim denotes that the issuer is Clockify and the `type` claim denotes that the intended usage for this token is to be used by add-ons.

The `sub` claim must also be verified to match the expected value, which must always be the key defined in the add-on [manifest](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/index.html).

`sub={add-on key}`

### Additional verification[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html)

[Webhook](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/webhooks.html) signatures require an [extra step](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/webhooks.html) to verify that the provided signature is the correct one for the expected event.

# Environments[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/environments-and-regions.html)

Add-ons should be able to be installed on every Clockify workspace, irrespective of environment where the workspace is located.

To ensure that add-ons will work on all environments, you should avoid making use of hardcoded values for API endpoints and UI locations and instead always retrieve environment-specific values from the token claims.

Different environments where a workspace can be located are:

* regions

Clockify workspaces can be located in each of the available regions. If a workspace is located on a region, the entirety of the data for that workspace is also located in that region.
Each region exposes its own API locations.

* subdomains

A Clockify workspace can also be located on a subdomain. Workspaces that are located on subdomains have custom UI locations. A workspace that is located on a subdomain can also be located on a specific region.

* development environments

When [testing your add-on](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/quick-start.html), you may notice that the environment on which you have installed the add-on is a completely separate one. The development environments use their own separate locations for all API endpoints.

## Ensuring add-ons will work irrespective of the environment[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/environments-and-regions.html)

To ensure that add-ons can work independent of the environment where they are installed, we have to retrieve all the environment-related information from the [add-on authentication token](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html) - which is in fact a [JWT](https://jwt.io/).

The following claims can be used to determine the locations where API calls must be made for a specific workspace:

`"backendUrl": "https://api.clockify.me/api",
"reportsUrl": "https://reports.api.clockify.me",
"locationsUrl": "https://locations.api.clockify.me",
"screenshotsUrl": "https://screenshots.api.clockify.me",`

The above claims represent the locations of the backend, reports, locations and screenshots API services.

## Retrieving information related to the add-on installation[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/environments-and-regions.html)

The add-on token contains other claims which may be used to identify the add-on installation and retrieve other useful information such as the workspace where the add-on is installed, or the user that is currently logged in.

The following claims can be used to retrieve more info related to the add-on installation:

`"sub": "{add-on key}",
"workspaceId": "{workspace id}",
"user": "{user id}",
"addonId": "{add-on id}",`

* sub - the sub field will be the same as the key that is defined in the add-on manifest. The sub is used to verify that the token is signed on behalf of your add-on.
* workspaceId - the ID of the workspace where the add-on is installed
* user - the ID of the workspace owner (for installation tokens), or the ID of the user who is currently logged in and viewing a UI component (for user tokens)
* addonId - the ID of the add-on installation on the workspace

The above claims are available for both [installation](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html) and [user](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html) tokens.

## Retrieving information related to the add-on user[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/environments-and-regions.html)

Apart from the claims which provide information related to the environment where the add-on is installed, there are also claims which provide information related to the user who is interacting with your add-on.

The following claims can be used to retrieve more info related to the user who is interacting with the add-on [UI components](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/index.html):

`"language": "EN",
"theme": "DEFAULT",
"workspaceRole": "OWNER",`

* language - the [language settings](https://clockify.me/help/administration/profile-settings) for the current user. You may use this to support multiple languages and localized content for you add-on.
* theme - the [theme settings](https://clockify.me/help/administration/profile-settings) for the current user. It is strongly recommended that your add-on uses the same theme colors the user has configured on Clockify.
* workspaceRole - the role of the current user on this workspace. Learn more about roles on the Clockify API [docs](https://docs.clockify.me/)

The above claims are only available for [user tokens](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html).

# Manifest[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest.html)

## Definition[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest.html)

A manifest is a file which describes an add-on and its functionalities.
Through the manifest you can define how your add-on integrates with Clockify.

### Schema[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest.html)

While there are several manifest schema versions available, you should always aim to support and use the latest version of the manifest schema.
At the time of writing, the latest manifest schema version is version ***1.3***. This section will describe version 1.3 of the manifest schema.

The manifest schema is defined in the [json schema](https://json-schema.org/) format and can be retrieved at any time from the Clockify developer API by calling the following endpoint:

`GET https://developer.clockify.me/api/addons/manifest-schema`

You can use the schema above to validate your manifest file and explore the different available options.

***Versions***

In specific circumstances (such as for compatibility reasons), you might want to use a previous version of the schema.
To do so, you have to explicitly define the `schemaVersion` attribute on the manifest.

To access a specific version of the manifest schema, you can call the following endpoint with the version parameter:

`GET https://developer.clockify.me/api/addons/manifest-schema?version=1.3`

### Top-level properties[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest.html)

| Property | Required | Updateable | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

"option 2": "option 2 value"
},
"iconPath": "/trt"
]`

## [Lifecycle](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/lifecycle.html)[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest.html)

Lifecycles contain events add-on receives when installed, deleted, or when its settings are updated.

| Property | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| path | yes | Path relative to the baseUrl |
| type | yes | The lifecycle event you want to subscribe to. Possible values: INSTALLED, SETTINGS\_UPDATED, STATUS\_CHANGED, DELETED |

Example

`"lifecycle": [
{
"path": "/postinstall",

},
{
"path": "/uninstalled",
"type": "DELETED"
}
]`

## [Webhooks](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/webhooks.html)[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest.html)

| Property | Required | Description |

{
"event": "NEW_TIME_ENTRY",
"path": "/new-time-entry"
},
{
"event": "NEW_CLIENT",
"path": "/new-client"
}
]`

> You can have a maximum of 10 webhooks per add-on.

## Settings[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest.html)

Add-on settings allow the add-on to present the user with a configuration screen where add-on specific settings can be configured.
If defined, settings will be shown under the menu dropdown of the add-on on the add-ons tab.

### Types[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest.html)

There are two types of settings an add-on can have:

* ***[structured settings](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/structured-settings.html)*** - you can configure the structure of the settings according to the settings [schema](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest.html). Clockify will take care of the persisting the settings.
* ***custom UI*** - you can configure a custom UI by supplying a string value as the value for the `settings` field. The value will be the path where the UI will be served. The custom settings UI will work the same way as [UI components](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest.html) do and will be loaded inside an iframe. If following this approach, you will be responsible for handling and storing your add-on's data.

## Subscription plan[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest.html)

Subscription plans represent the plans a workspace can be subscribed to on Clockify and the features that are available to said workspace.

Below is the list of plans that are currently supported:

* FREE
* BASIC
* STANDARD
* PRO
* ENTERPRISE

You can read more about the different subscription plans, and the features that are available to each plan, on the [following link](https://clockify.me/help/administration/subscription-plans).

## Scopes[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest.html)

The scopes represent the permissions of an add-on and constrain the APIs and data that the add-on can access when interacting with the [Clockify API](https://docs.clockify.me/).
A scope consists of a resource and an action. Actions can be READ or WRITE.

> Requesting the WRITE permission for a resource does not automatically grant the add-on READ permission.

> Attempting to call endpoints without declaring the appropriate scopes on the manifest will result in the request failing with a status of HTTP 403 FORBIDDEN.

It should be noted that even if a specific feature is available on the workspace plan and the relevant scopes are requested, the feature still needs to be enabled in the workspace settings in order for the APIs for that feature to work.

Below is the list of scopes that an add-on can declare in its manifest:

* CLIENT\_READ
* CLIENT\_WRITE
* PROJECT\_READ
* PROJECT\_WRITE
* TAG\_READ
* TAG\_WRITE
* TASK\_READ
* TASK\_WRITE,
* TIME\_ENTRY\_READ
* TIME\_ENTRY\_WRITE
* EXPENSE\_READ
* EXPENSE\_WRITE
* INVOICE\_READ
* INVOICE\_WRITE
* USER\_READ
* USER\_WRITE
* GROUP\_READ
* GROUP\_WRITE
* WORKSPACE\_READ
* WORKSPACE\_WRITE
* CUSTOM\_FIELDS\_READ
* CUSTOM\_FIELDS\_WRITE
* APPROVAL\_READ
* APPROVAL\_WRITE
* SCHEDULING\_READ
* SCHEDULING\_WRITE
* REPORTS\_READ
* REPORTS\_WRITE
* TIME\_OFF\_READ
* TIME\_OFF\_WRITE

# UI Components[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/components.html)

The UI components are pages which are used to integrate your add-ons UI with Clockify. They serve as an entry point to the user's interaction with your add-on.

UI components are served as HTML pages and loaded inside [iframes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe) when redered on the Clockify site. At the time of loading, components will be provided with the relevant context they need in order to function such as an [authentication token](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html) as well as information the current location on the app and [information about the user](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/environments-and-regions.html).

Entrypoints to your components can be added to a variety of available [locations](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/components.html) on the Clockify site.

## Definition[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/components.html)

UI components must be defined in the [add-on manifest](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/index.html). They contain information about the location, label, icon and other component-specific attributes as detailed on the [components section of the manifest](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/index.html).
Components can be added, modified or removed in subsequent [versions of you add-on](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines.html). Changes to an add-on components will not take effect until the new version of the add-on is approved and published.

### Settings UI[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/components.html)

The [settings UI](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/index.html) is also a UI component, with the only difference being that it's not defined as part of the `components` but rather as part of the `settings` field of the manifest.

## Interacting with the API[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/components.html)

UI components can interact with the [Clockify API](https://docs.clockify.me/) in two ways:

* by calling the [API](https://docs.clockify.me/) directly

All components are provided with an [authentication token](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html) in the form of a query parameter. This token has the same permissions and access as the user who is currently viewing the UI.
This token, which in case it's provided to UI components is called the `user token`, can be used to make authenticated requests to the [Clockify API](https://docs.clockify.me/).

* by interacting with an add-on backend service

In this case it's up to the developer to implement the relevant authentication mechanisms and APIs.
The add-on will be provided with an [installation token](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html) in case the `installed` lifecycle has been configured, although you may also choose to forward the [user token](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html) to your backend service as part of the requests.

## Types[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/components.html)

There are three types of components in Clockify, each having its own location where the component will be shown.

### Sidebar[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/components.html)

A sidebar entry is an entry that is added to the add-ons section of the Clockify sidebar, located on the left side of the page.
New entries always default to the add-ons section, although they can be manually moved according to the user's preferences.
Add-on can add new element in a sidebar automatically, or if user enables it through ***Settings*** by clicking ***Show more*** and ***Add-ons***.

Now, you can specify sidebar’s properties:

* Added if at least one enabled add-on has “Sidebar” component specified in manifest
* Not removed even if empty
* Users can put other elements in it (from other sections)
* New add-on sidebar elements are always added to the Add-on section

Element can be moved from the ***Add-on*** to other sections and is removed from the ***Add-on*** section if it is uninstalled or disabled in the optional add-on’s settings.

### Widget[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/components.html)

A widget is a small icon which is displayed at the bottom-right section of the page. It serves an entrypoint to UI components that are defined with the `WIDGET` type.

The widget icon will serve as an entrypoint to one or more UI components according to the rules below:

***Widget icon*** is displayed if at least one add-on with widget component is installed and enabled at the bottom right corner of the page.

***Widget list*** is displayed if more than one add-on with widget component is installed and enabled at the bottom right corner of the page.

Widget is not visible if there are no installed add-ons that have widget as a component in the manifest, or if all add-ons with widget component are disabled.

### Tabs[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/components.html)

A tab is a location that can be defined for components which extend the functionality of existing pages with tabs. Add-on tabs will be added after the default tabs of the pages that support them.

Add-on can add new element in tab automatically, or if user enables it through ***Settings***. Add-on tabs are added after the existing tabs and are sorted by the date when they where added.

Tabs can be added to the following pages:

* Time off
* Schedule
* Approvals
* Reports
* Activity
* Team
* Project

### Settings UI[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/components.html)

The [Settings UI](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/components.html) is technically also a UI location, although it must be configured on the settings field rather than as a component.
The UI can be accessed through the add-on options dropdown on the add-ons tab.

## Access[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/components.html)

A component can be configured to be visible to everyone, or only to users with the admin role.

"label": "${sidebarLabel}",
"accessLevel": "ADMINS",
"path": "${sidebarPath}",
"options": {
"option 1": "option 1 value",
"option 2": "option 2 value"
},
"iconPath": "/trt"
]`

## [Lifecycle](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/lifecycle.html)[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/index.html)

Lifecycles contain events add-on receives when installed, deleted, or when its settings are updated.

| Property | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| path | yes | Path relative to the baseUrl |
| type | yes | The lifecycle event you want to subscribe to. Possible values: INSTALLED, SETTINGS\_UPDATED, STATUS\_CHANGED, DELETED |

Example

`"lifecycle": [
{
"path": "/postinstall",
"type": "INSTALLED"
},
{
"path": "/uninstalled",
"type": "DELETED"
}
]`

## [Webhooks](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/webhooks.html)[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/index.html)

| Property | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| path | yes | Path of the endpoint relative to the baseUrl. |
| event | yes | The even that is being subscribed to. Possible values can be found on the [webhooks](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/webhooks.html) section. |

Example

`"webhooks": [
{
"event": "NEW_TIME_ENTRY",
"path": "/new-time-entry"
},
{
"event": "NEW_CLIENT",
"path": "/new-client"
}
]`

> You can have a maximum of 10 webhooks per add-on.

## Settings[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/index.html)

Add-on settings allow the add-on to present the user with a configuration screen where add-on specific settings can be configured.
If defined, settings will be shown under the menu dropdown of the add-on on the add-ons tab.

### Types[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/index.html)

There are two types of settings an add-on can have:

* ***[structured settings](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/structured-settings.html)*** - you can configure the structure of the settings according to the settings [schema](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/index.html). Clockify will take care of the persisting the settings.
* ***custom UI*** - you can configure a custom UI by supplying a string value as the value for the `settings` field. The value will be the path where the UI will be served. The custom settings UI will work the same way as [UI components](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/index.html) do and will be loaded inside an iframe. If following this approach, you will be responsible for handling and storing your add-on's data.

## Subscription plan[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/index.html)

Subscription plans represent the plans a workspace can be subscribed to on Clockify and the features that are available to said workspace.

Below is the list of plans that are currently supported:

* FREE
* BASIC
* STANDARD
* PRO
* ENTERPRISE

You can read more about the different subscription plans, and the features that are available to each plan, on the [following link](https://clockify.me/help/administration/subscription-plans).

## Scopes[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/index.html)

The scopes represent the permissions of an add-on and constrain the APIs and data that the add-on can access when interacting with the [Clockify API](https://docs.clockify.me/).
A scope consists of a resource and an action. Actions can be READ or WRITE.

> Requesting the WRITE permission for a resource does not automatically grant the add-on READ permission.

> Attempting to call endpoints without declaring the appropriate scopes on the manifest will result in the request failing with a status of HTTP 403 FORBIDDEN.

It should be noted that even if a specific feature is available on the workspace plan and the relevant scopes are requested, the feature still needs to be enabled in the workspace settings in order for the APIs for that feature to work.

Below is the list of scopes that an add-on can declare in its manifest:

* CLIENT\_READ
* CLIENT\_WRITE
* PROJECT\_READ
* PROJECT\_WRITE
* TAG\_READ
* TAG\_WRITE
* TASK\_READ
* TASK\_WRITE,
* TIME\_ENTRY\_READ
* TIME\_ENTRY\_WRITE
* EXPENSE\_READ
* EXPENSE\_WRITE
* INVOICE\_READ
* INVOICE\_WRITE
* USER\_READ
* USER\_WRITE
* GROUP\_READ
* GROUP\_WRITE
* WORKSPACE\_READ
* WORKSPACE\_WRITE
* CUSTOM\_FIELDS\_READ
* CUSTOM\_FIELDS\_WRITE
* APPROVAL\_READ
* APPROVAL\_WRITE
* SCHEDULING\_READ
* SCHEDULING\_WRITE
* REPORTS\_READ
* REPORTS\_WRITE
* TIME\_OFF\_READ
* TIME\_OFF\_WRITE

# Lifecycle[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/lifecycle.html)

## Definition[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/lifecycle.html)

The lifecycle of an add-on consists of all the steps beginning from when it's installed until when the add-on gets uninstalled.

Throughout its lifecycle whe add-on may be in one of the two states:

* active - it's loaded on the Clockify UI, receives events and can interact with the Clockify API
* inactive - it's not loaded and cannot interact with Clockify, but it's still installed and all the user data are still kept

A general lifecycle of an add-on includes the following events:

* Installed
* Status changed
* Settings updated
* Deleted

## Types[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/lifecycle.html)

### Installed[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/lifecycle.html)

Add-on is installed on a workspace.

To receive this event, the add-on must declare the `INSTALLED` lifecycle hook as part of its lifecycles.
During installation, a lifecycle event is triggered and the add-on is provided with the installation context and a set of [tokens](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html).

> It is important to note that this payload will only be supplied **once** for each add-on installation.

We recommend persisting the installation payload in your database if your add-on meets, or plans to meet in the future, the use cases where an [installation token](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html) may be needed.

The data included in the installation payload, including the API URLs and tokens, are dependent on the environment and the region where the add-on is installed. If you intend to interact with the Clockify APIs, you **must** always use the [appropriate URLs](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html) for the specific environment.

Example of a payload that is sent as part of the `INSTALLED` event:

```
1Request Headers
2Content-Type : application/json
3X-Addon-Lifecycle-Token : {{token}}
4
5{
6  "addonId": "62ddf9b201f42e74228efa3c",
7  "authToken": "{{token}}",
8  "workspaceId": "60332d61ff30282b1f23e624",
9  "asUser": "60348d63df70d82b7183e635",
10  "apiUrl": "{{apiUrl}}",
11  "addonUserId": "1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1k2l",
12  "webhooks": [{
13     "path": "https://example.com/webhook"
14     "webhookType": "ADDON"
15     "authToken": "{{token}}"
16  }], 
17}
```

The `authToken` is an API token that can be used to make authenticated requests to the Clockify API. For more information, read the [Authentication and authorization](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html) sectuib.

### Status changed[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/lifecycle.html)

After installation, the add-on is automatically enabled and becomes active.

There are cases where the user may choose to deactivate an add-on instead of uninstalling it, for instance if they do not wish to use the add-on at the present but still want to preserve their settings and configurations.

To receive this event, the add-on must declare the `STATUS_CHANGED` lifecycle hook as part of its lifecycles.

Example of a payload that is sent as part of the `STATUS_CHANGED` event:

```
1Request Headers
2Content-Type : application/json
3X-Addon-Lifecycle-Token : {{token}}
4
5{
6  "addonId": "62ddf9b201f42e74228efa3c",
7  "workspaceId": "60332d61ff30282b1f23e624",
8  "status": "INACTIVE"
9}
```

> The `status` values can be either `ACTIVE` or `INACTIVE`

### Settings updated[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/lifecycle.html)

An add-on can have its [settings structure](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/structured-settings.html) defined inside the manifest.
In these cases, the add-on can subscribe to the `SETTINGS_UPDATED` lifecycle hook to be notified anytime one of its users updates the settings for the add-on.

Example of a payload that is sent as part of the `SETTINGS_UPDATED` event:

```
1Request Headers
2Content-Type : application/json
3X-Addon-Lifecycle-Token : {{token}}
4
5{
6  "workspaceId": "60332d61ff30282b1f23e624",
7  "addonId": "62ddf9b201f42e74228efa3c",
8  "settings": [
9    {
10      "id": "txt-setting",
11      "name": "Txt setting",
12      "value": "Some text"
13    },
14    {
15      "id": "link-setting",
16      "name": "Link setting",
17      "value": "https://clockify.me"
18    },
19    {
20      "id": "number-setting",
21      "name": "Number setting",
22      "value": 5
23    },
24    {
25      "id": "checkbox-setting",
26      "name": "Checkbox setting",
27      "value": true
28    },
29    {
30      "id": "dropdown-single-setting",
31      "name": "Dropdown single setting",
32      "value": "option 1"
33    },
34    {
35      "id": "dropdown-multiple-setting",
36      "name": "Dropdown multiple setting",
37      "value": [
38        "option 1",
39        "option 2"
40      ]
41    }
42  ]
43}
```

### Deleted[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/lifecycle.html)

When an add-on is deleted from a workspace, a lifecycle event is triggered and the add-on is provided with the context for the installation that is being uninstalled.
All the [tokens](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html) that are provided to the add-on become invalid and from that moment on, the add-on can no longer interact with the Clockify API on behalf of the workspace user.

Example of a payload that is sent as part of the `DELETED` event:

`DELETED`

```
1Request Headers
2Content-Type : application/json
3X-Addon-Lifecycle-Token : {{token}}
4
5{
6  "addonId": "62ddf9b201f42e74228efa3c",
7  "workspaceId": "60332d61ff30282b1f23e624",
8  "asUser": "60348d63df70d82b7183e635"
9}

# Structured settings[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/structured-settings.html)

## Definition[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/structured-settings.html)

Structured settings are a way for you to easily and declaratively create a UI for the settings of your add-on.

Structured settings are a great way to get started with building the settings for your add-on while ensuring they integrate flawlessly with Clockify's UI and follow the same [styling guidelines](https://www.figma.com/@cake_dot_com) as Clockify does.
The structure of the settings is flexible and capable of building and supporting complex settings structures and UIs.

### Interactions[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/structured-settings.html)

* UI

Clockify handles building and rendering the UI for the add-on settings, as well as persisting the settings whenever they are updated.

* APIs

Clockify exposes a [set of APIs](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/structured-settings.html) that add-ons can use to retrieve and update their settings for a particular workspace.

* Lifecycle

Add-ons can subscribe to the [settings updated](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/lifecycle.html) lifecycle event to be notified whenever the settings are updated.

## Properties[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/structured-settings.html)

This section will briefly describe the structure of the settings definition. More details and possible values for a particular field can be found under the `definitions` list of the [manifest schema](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/index.html) for the manifest version that you are targeting.

Settings are organized by nesting tabs and groups. Values and types of the settings must be compatible.

### Tabs[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/structured-settings.html)

Tabs are at the top level of hierarchy when defining settings.

Tabs cannot be nested in other tabs or groups, and they need to have at least one type of settings defined.
If the `groups` property is defined, it needs to have at least one `settings` property defined in it.
For more information on `groups`, check out the [Groups](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/structured-settings.html) section.

| Property | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | yes | Tab identifier |
| name | yes | Tab name, will be displayed on the UI |
| header | no | Text shown on the settings header |
| settings | no | List of [settings](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/structured-settings.html) contained in the tab |
| groups | no | List of [groups](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/structured-settings.html) contained in the tab |

Example

`"settings": {
"tabs": [
{
"id": "Tab id",
"name": "Tab one title",
"header": {
"title": "Title text"
},
"groups": [
{
"id": "Group id",
"title": "Group one title",
"description": "Group description",
"header": {
"title": "Header title"
},
"settings": [
{
"id": "Setting id",
"name": "Default setting",
"description": "Description of default setting",
"placeholder": "Default setting here...",
"type": "TXT",
"value": "Value of default setting",
"required": true,
"copyable": true,
"readOnly": false,
"accessLevel": "ADMINS"
}
]
}
],
"settings": [
{
"id": "Tab setting",
"name": "Tab setting",
"type": "TXT",
"value": "Some value",
"required": true,
"accessLevel": "EVERYONE"
}
]
}
]}
]`

### Groups[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/structured-settings.html)

Groups are a way to link related settings. Group can be part of tabs, and one tab can contain multiple groups.

| Property | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | yes | Group identifier |
| title | yes | Group title, will be displayed on the UI |
| description | no | Brief description the settings group |
| header | no | Text shown on the group header |
| settings | yes | List of [settings](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/structured-settings.html) contained in the group |

Example

`"groups": [
{
"id": "Group id",
"title": "Group one title",
"description": "Group description",
"header": {
"title": "Header title"
},
"settings": [
{
"id": "Setting id",
"name": "Default setting",
"description": "Description of default setting",
"placeholder": "Default setting here...",
"type": "TXT",
"value": "Value of default setting",
"required": true,
"copyable": true,
"readOnly": false,
"accessLevel": "ADMINS"
}
]
}
]`

### Settings[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/structured-settings.html)

This is the actual settings object which defines the individual setting elements.

| Property | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | yes | Unique identifier for the settings property |
| name | yes | Property name, will be displayed on the UI |
| description | no | Brief description of the property |
| placeholder | no | Placeholder that will be displayed if the value empty |
| type | yes | Settings’ type. Each type is displayed differently on the UI |
| key | no | Serves as the key for the settings when retrieved as key value pairs |
| value | yes | Settings’ value. It must match with the type of settings defined in the `type` property |
| allowedValues | no\* | List of allowed values for settings of the dropdown type. \*Required if type of settings is DROPDOWN\_SINGLE or DROPDOWN\_MULTIPLE |
| required | no | Defines if the setting is required |
| copyable | no | Defines if a ‘Copy’ button will be added next to the setting value on the UI |
| readOnly | no | Defines if the setting value is read-only |
| accessLevel | yes | Defines the access level a user must have in order to access this setting |

Example

`"settings": [
{
"id": "Setting id",
"name": "Default setting",
"description": "Description of default setting",
"placeholder": "Default setting here...",
"type": "TXT",
"value": "Value of default setting",
"required": true,
"copyable": true,
"readOnly": false,
"accessLevel": "ADMINS"
}
]`

## Endpoints[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/structured-settings.html)

Clockify exposes the following API endpoints which can be used to interact with the stored settings of an add-on:

> The requests to these APIs must be [authenticated](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html).

***Retrieving Settings***

`Headers:
X-Addon-Token: {token}
GET /addon/workspaces/{workspaceId}/settings`

The endpoint requires the following parameters:

* workspaceId – ID of workspace where the add-on is installed, can be retrieved from the [claims present in the authentication token](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html)

The settings are specific to an add-on installation on a given workspace.

Sample Response:

`{
"tabs": [
{
"name": "Tab one title",
"id": "tab one id",
"groups": [
{
"id": "group nested in tab",
"title": "Group title",
"description": "group description",
"header": {
"title": "Header title"
},
"settings": [
{
"id": "Setting id",
"name": "Default setting",
"description": "Description of default setting",
"placeholder": "Default setting here...",
"type": "TXT",
"value": "Value of default setting",
"required": true,
"copyable": true,
"readOnly": false,
"accessLevel": "ADMINS"
}
]
}
],
"header": {
"title": "title header 2"
},
"settings": [
{
"id": "Setting id 2",
"name": "Default setting",
"description": "Description of default setting",
"placeholder": "Default setting here...",
"type": "TXT",
"value": "Value of default setting 2",
"required": true,
"copyable": true,
"readOnly": false,
"accessLevel": "ADMINS"
}
]
}
]
}`

***Updating settings***

The following endpoint can be used to update one or more add-on settings by providing the unique settings IDs.

`Headers:
X-Addon-Token: {token}
PATCH /addon/workspaces/{workspaceId}/settings
[
{
"id": "settingId",
"value": "New value of setting"
}
]`

# Webhooks[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/webhooks.html)

## Definition[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/webhooks.html)

Webhooks are a way for your add-on to respond to events and triggers in real-time without the user directly interacting with the add-on UI itself.
They can be used to integrate your add-on with Clockify in a seamless way.

Webhook messages are automatically sent by Clockify whenever an event that the add-on has subscribed to is triggered.
Clockify provides a variety of [Webhook Event types](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/webhooks.html) that an add-on can subscribe to according to its needs.

## Types[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/webhooks.html)

There are different types of webhooks that your add-on can subscribe to.
The webhooks that are available for your add-on depend on the specific version of the [manifest schema](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/index.html) that you choose.

Generally, the following webhooks are available to add-ons:

`NEW_PROJECT
PROJECT_UPDATED
PROJECT_DELETED
NEW_TASK
TASK_UPDATED
TASK_DELETED
NEW_CLIENT
CLIENT_UPDATED
CLIENT_DELETED
NEW_TAG
TAG_UPDATED
TAG_DELETED
NEW_TIMER_STARTED
TIMER_STOPPED
TIME_ENTRY_UPDATED
TIME_ENTRY_DELETED
NEW_TIME_ENTRY
NEW_INVOICE
INVOICE_UPDATED
USER_JOINED_WORKSPACE
USER_DELETED_FROM_WORKSPACE
USER_DEACTIVATED_ON_WORKSPACE
USER_ACTIVATED_ON_WORKSPACE
USER_EMAIL_CHANGED
USER_UPDATED
NEW_APPROVAL_REQUEST
APPROVAL_REQUEST_STATUS_UPDATED
TIME_OFF_REQUESTED
TIME_OFF_REQUEST_APPROVED
TIME_OFF_REQUEST_REJECTED
TIME_OFF_REQUEST_WITHDRAWN
BALANCE_UPDATED
USER_GROUP_CREATED
USER_GROUP_UPDATED
USER_GROUP_DELETED
EXPENSE_CREATED
EXPENSE_UPDATED
EXPENSE_DELETED
ASSIGNMENT_CREATED
ASSIGNMENT_UPDATED
ASSIGNMENT_DELETED
ASSIGNMENT_PUBLISHED`

You can test and visualize how the webhooks work and their respective payloads by triggering and listening for the events on your [development environment](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/quick-start.html).

## Requests[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/webhooks.html)

Webhook requests are `POST` requests that are sent to notify the add-on of events it has subscribed to.
Each specific event will contain its specific payload as well as an accompanying [signature](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/webhooks.html) that can be used to verify the request.
After installing an add-on, you can view a list of all the registered webhooks by navigating to the add-ons tab and clicking on the webhooks option.

A list of all the registered webhooks along with their endpoints will be displayed.

You can access a webhook's logs by clicking on the webhook event. The logs will contain information such as the timestamp when the request was made, the HTTP status as well as the request and response bodies.

> Webhook logs are deleted after 7 days.

## Signature[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/webhooks.html)

Each webhook that is dispatched by Clockify will contain a signature that can be used to verify its authenticity.
A typical webhook request will contain the following request headers:

`clockify-signature - this represents the token that is signed on behalf of a single webhook type for a single add-on installation
clockify-webhook-event-type - this represents the event that triggered the webhook, must be one of the webhook values above`

### Webhook token[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/webhooks.html)

The webhook token supplied as part of the `clockify-signature` headers does not expire.
It contains the following claims that can be used to verify its authenticity and determine its context:

`"iss": "clockify",
"sub": "{add-on key}",
"type": "addon",
"workspaceId": "{workspace id}",
"addonId": "{add-on id}"`

* iss - the issuer of a JWT will always be `clockify`
* sub - the sub must be the same as the add-on key
* type - the type of a JWT will always be `addon`
* workspaceId - the ID where the add-on is installed and where the event was triggered
* addonId - the ID of the add-on installation on the workspace

### Authenticity[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/webhooks.html)

There are a couple of precautions that we must take to verify a webhook's authenticity and prevent request spoofing.

1. Verify the JWT

The JWT token must be verified and the issuer and the sub claims must match the expected values for our add-on. To learn more about the tokens, visit the [Authentication & Authorization](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html) section.

2. Assert the webhook type is the one you expect

You must assert that the webhook types and the payloads supplied with the request match the webhook types that you expect for each endpoint.

3. Compare webhook tokens

When an add-on which has defined an [installed lifecycle](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/index.html) gets installed on a workspace, an installation payload is provided along with the `installed` event.
If the add-on has defined webhooks in its manifest, the payload will contain information regarding registered webhooks as well as the webhook token for each of them.

`{
...
"webhooks": [
{
"authToken": "{JWT for the webhook}",
"path": "{path defined in the manifest}",
"webhookType": "ADDON"
}
],
...
}`

It is recommended that add-ons retrieve and store the `authToken` for each registered webhook, so that it can later be used to verify the authenticity of the requests.

The webhook token does not expire, and the same token registered for a particular webhook will be sent as part of the `clockify-signature` header for every webhook event of that type that is triggered on the workspace.

* [Event subscription](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/window-events.html)
* [Event dispatch](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/window-events.html)

# Window messages[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/window-events.html)

Clockify uses the [window message API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) in order to allow add-on developers receive messages about specific events and react accordingly.

Clockify supports two-way event communications, where the add-on can subscribe to specific events as well as dispatch events that should trigger actions on the Clockify site.

### Event subscription[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/window-events.html)

Below is a sample snippet showing how to register a listener for an event:

```
1handleWindowMessage = (message) => {
2  console.log(message.data.title)
3}
4
5window.addEventListener("message", (event) => handleWindowMessage(event))
```

***Events***

Events will contain the following fields:

`message.data.title
message.data.body`

The title field will be the name of the event.
The body field will be an optional payload which depends on the event type.

Current events that can be listened for are:

* URL\_CHANGED

`message.data.body={the URL}`

* TIME\_ENTRY\_STARTED
* TIME\_ENTRY\_CREATED
* TIME\_ENTRY\_STOPPED
* TIME\_ENTRY\_DELETED
* TIME\_ENTRY\_UPDATED
* TIME\_TRACKING\_SETTINGS\_UPDATED
* WORKSPACE\_SETTINGS\_UPDATED
* PROFILE\_UPDATED
* USER\_SETTINGS\_UPDATED

> The above events are not final and are subject to change in the future.

### Event dispatch[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/window-events.html)

In addition to listening for events that Clockify dispatches, the add-on can also interact with Clockify by triggering its own events.

Current events that can be dispatched from the add-on are:

* refreshAddonToken - asks Clockify to refresh the add-on token for the user that is currently viewing the UI component. Learn more about tokens and their contexts on the [Authentication & Authorization](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html) section.
* preview - if dispatched from an add-on, it will ask Clockify to open a modal with the add-on's marketplace listing.
* navigate - asks Clockify to navigate to the location specified by the `type` parameter. It requires the following payload:

```
1{
2  "type": "tracker"
3}
```

The following is a list of supported navigation locations:

`- tracker`

* toastrPop - asks Clockify to show custom toast messages on the UI.
  It requires the following payload:

```
1{
2  "type": "info" | "warning" | "success" | "error",
3  "message": "your message"
4}
```

Toast messages will be shown on the bottom-right section of the screen. The color of the background depends on the message type.

The following screenshot displays how an `error` toast would look like in the UI:

***Javascript Example***

The following code example asks Clockify to display an error toast message like in the screenshot above.

```
1window.top?.postMessage(JSON.stringify({ action: "toastrPop", payload: { type: "error", message: "Your add-on toast message" } }), "*");
```

# Introduction[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/introduction.html)

## Clockify Add-on basics[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/introduction.html)

### What is the structure of an add-on?[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/introduction.html)

Each add-on has three main elements:

* Manifest
* Business logic
* UI (optional)

***[Manifest](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/index.html)*** describes the add-on’s capabilities and the way it integrates with the Clockify app.

***Business logic*** represents the functionalities provided by an add-on.

***[UI](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/components.html)*** is the visual representation of an add-on that is displayed to users. Add-ons that don’t contain a UI can also be developed.

### How does add-on hosting infrastructure work?[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/introduction.html)

Add-on resources are not hosted by CAKE.com. You must host all the resources needed for an add-on to function, including a manifest file, a database, a web server to handle communication with Clockify and any other integral part of an add-on e.g. UI.

You need to make sure that all the resources mentioned above are working and accessible.

### How does the add-on interact with the Clockify API?[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/introduction.html)

An add-on interacts with [Clockify's API](https://docs.clockify.me/) by supplying an [authentication token](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html) as part of the `X-Addon-Token` header.
This authentication token will be commonly called the `add-on token` throughout the documentation.

There are several ways this token can be retrieved, as well as several [types of tokens](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html) that are available.
The two primary ways an add-on token can be retrieved are:

* during installation as part of the `installed` [lifecycle](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/lifecycle.html)
* when a [UI component](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/components.html) is loaded

### How does the add-on UI integrate with Clockify?[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/introduction.html)

An add-on can define its UI elements in the manifest by defining [UI components](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/components.html).

UI components are entry points to the UI of the add-on. They are HTML pages which Clockify loads inside [iframes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe) in order to integrate them into Clockify's UI.
There are [several types](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/components.html) of UI components, each with its own locations, that can be configured.

### How does the add-on UI interact with Clockify?[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/introduction.html)

UI components can interact with Clockify in several ways:

* by calling the [Clockify API](https://docs.clockify.me/)
* by calling the add-on backend, which in turn interacts with the Clockify API
* by listening to or dispatching [window events](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/window-events.html)

UI components are loaded and rendered inside iframes. At the time they are loaded, the components are provided with an [authentication token](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html) that they can use in order to communicate with the Clockify API.
This authentication token will also contain a [set of claims](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html) that can be used to retrieve information regarding the environment, the workspace and the user that is currently viewing the UI.

### How do add-on settings work?[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/introduction.html)

There are two ways an add-on can display an interface for its settings:

* ***Using configurable no-code UI***

Add-on settings can be defined in the [manifest](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/index.html) with Clockify taking care of both rendering them to the user and storing the data.
This approach is the fastest way to get started with building add-ons and supports building customizable settings screens in a straightforward way.
Visit the [structured settings](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/structured-settings.html) section for more information.

* ***Using a custom settings UI***

An add-on can be configured to define and host its own settings screen. This setup can be beneficial if the UI is complex, if you’d like to store settings in your own infrastructure, or if the settings need to follow a specific design.
The settings UI will work the same as any other [UI component](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/components.html).

### How does an add-on work?[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/introduction.html)

After an add-on is installed, it's added to the workspace and loaded whenever a user loads the Clockify app.

There are several ways in which Clockify interacts with the add-on:

* ***Lifecycle events***: Add-on receives events when installed, deleted, if its settings are updated, or status is changed
* ***Webhooks***: Add-on receives webhooks for all the events it has subscribed to on the manifest
* ***Components***: Add-on receives requests to render a component whenever a user navigates to it
* ***Components Window Messages***: Add-on components can receive [window events](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/window-events.html) after they are loaded

An add-on can work in both interactive (responding to user interactions or events) and non-interactive (responding to Clockify webhooks or processing server side jobs) ways.

### Can new features be added after an add-on is published?[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/introduction.html)

You can add new features or improve existing ones after an add-on is published.

However, there are certain changes that require updating the manifest and/or other data such as the add-on name and the [marketplace](https://marketplace.cake.com/) listing that are required to go through an approval process.

Changes to the manifest, such as adding or updating components, lifecycle webhooks or scopes, will only take effect after a new version of the add-on is approved and published.

## Developer Resources[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/introduction.html)

***Add-on code examples***

[Add-on code examples](https://github.com/clockify/addon-examples) are used to demonstrate how to use add-on’s specific features or functionality. These examples are tested and functional, therefore you can use them as a reference and build upon them to create your own custom integrations.

***Add-on SDK***

[Add-on SDK](https://github.com/clockify/addon-java-sdk) is written in Java and aims to help you with the development of your add-ons. It contains various modules to help you with the development, including schema models, validators, helpers, as well as support for web frameworks.

***Add-on web components***

Add-on web components are a set of components and CSS styles aimed to help you develop your UIs, and, at the same time maintain a design style that is consistent with the [CAKE.com style guide](https://www.figma.com/@cake_dot_com).
For more information, visit the Add-on web components [documentation](https://resources.developer.clockify.me/ui/latest/showcase/?path=/story/introduction--page).

# Clockify Add-on Quick Start Guide[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/quick-start)

## Developer account[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/quick-start)

Before starting our development process, we will need to create a CAKE.com developer account.
A developer account will allow us to publish, manage and monetize our add-ons as well as provide us with a testing environment and workspace where the add-on can be installed and tested during development.
You can learn more about how to get started with the developer account [here](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/developer-account.html).

## Let’s get started with developing a simple add-on.[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/quick-start)

In this guide we’ll build a new add-on from scratch and go through the development steps one by one, but first we have to define what an add-on is.

Add-ons are software components that can be used to extend the functionalities of CAKE.com products.
They are technology-agnostic, meaning they can be developed using the languages and frameworks of your choice.
For this guide we will be writing our add-on in Java, using the CAKE.com [Addon SDK](https://github.com/clockify/addon-java-sdk) and [UI Kit](https://resources.developer.clockify.me/ui/latest/showcase/?path=/story/introduction--page).

## Defining our add-on and its scope[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/quick-start)

Before starting our development process, we’ll need to define how our add-on will look like and what it aims to achieve.

For this guide, we will create a simple add-on which will add a new page to the Clockify's sidebar and will display a statistic of the time tracked by the current user.
As part of the guide we will implement and host a backend service and also integrate our add-on into Clockify’s UI.

## What to build[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/quick-start)

If you’re not sure what to build and what needs users have, you can check our
[roadmap](https://clockify.me/roadmap) and get ideas from suggested add-ons or feedback
[Forum](https://forum.clockify.me/) categories.

## Setting up a new project[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/quick-start)

We’ll start our development flow by creating a new project for our add-on. Let’s call it “Time Reports”.

1. We’ll create our first file named TimeReportsAddon.java, containing the following code:

```
1package com.cake.marketplace.examples.timereports;
2
3public class TimeReportsAddon {
4    public static void main(String[] args) {
5    }
6}
```

2. We’ll need to set up our Maven dependencies. This step consists of three parts:

* Configure and authenticate Github with maven as described in the following [page](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-apache-maven-registry).
* Configure our package repository in the ***pom.xml*** file by adding the following snippet:

`<repositories>
<repository>
<id>github</id>
<url>https://maven.pkg.github.com/clockify/addon-java-sdk</url>
</repository>
</repositories>`

* Configure our package dependency in the ***pom.xml*** file by adding the following snippet:

`<dependencies>
<dependency>
<groupId>com.cake.clockify</groupId>
<artifactId>addon-sdk</artifactId>
<version>1.4.0</version>
</dependency>
</dependencies>`

## Building our manifest[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/quick-start)

Now that we have successfully set up our project and dependencies we can start working on the add-on itself.
First, let's briefly explain what a manifest is.

A manifest is a file which describes an add-on and its functionalities.
Through the manifest you can define how your add-on integrates with CAKE.com products.

The format of the manifest file depends on the CAKE.com product your add-on is targeting, but in general will contain information about the add-on such as its identifier, name, permission scopes and other definitions that describe how it will interact with the product.
You can read more about the manifest, its syntax and various options on the [manifest](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/index.html) section of the documentation.

The Addon SDK provides a simple way to build and host our manifest file dynamically.
Let’s start by defining the manifest object, and then we’ll go over the details.

Our *main()* method will look like this:

```
1public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
2    var manifest = ClockifyManifest.v1_3Builder()
3        .key("time-reports-example")
4        .name("Time Reports")
5        .baseUrl("")
6        .requireFreePlan()
7        .description("Example add-on that displays time statistics")
8        .scopes(List.of(ClockifyScope.TIME_ENTRY_READ))
9        .build();
10}
```

Let’s go over the lines step by step.

* Builder interface

We'll start by using the builder interface to guide us through the steps needed to construct our manifest.
The manifest builder interface exposes one method for each supported schema version. In this guide we will use version 1.3 of the manifest schema.

* Key

The add-on key acts as an identifier for our add-on and must be a unique value among all add-ons published on the CAKE.com marketplace.

* Name

The add-on name is also a required field and must match the name under which the add-on gets published to the CAKE.com marketplace.
In the UI, the name will be displayed on Clockify's add-on settings tab.

* Base URL

The base URL is the URL that will act as the base location for our add-on. Other paths will be defined relative to this URL.
We're setting it to an empty value at this point as we do not yet have a publicly available URL we can use.

* Subscription plan

The minimal subscription plan is the minimum plan that Clockify workspaces must have in order to be able to install and use our add-on.
The `requireFreePlan()` method is a helper which sets the minimum required plan value to ‘FREE’.
Other supported values for the plan can be found on the manifest section.

* Description

The description field is an optional field, and can be populated with a short description of the add-on.
The text will be visible on Clockify's add-on settings tab.

* Scopes

Scopes are optional, but have to be defined if we intend to use certain features of the Clockify API.
For our example we need to request the `TIME_ENTRY_READ` scope since we will be making requests to the time entries endpoint.

## Building our UI component[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/quick-start)

Now that we've built the manifest object, the next step will be to define and serve our UI component.
Let's start by defining our component first, and then we'll get to the HTML part of the UI.

```
1var uiComponent = ClockifyComponent.builder()
2    .sidebar()
3    .allowEveryone()
4    .path("/sidebar-component")
5    .label("Time Reports")
6    .build();
```

In this guide we will be defining a single UI component which will be shown as a separate entry on the sidebar.

* Builder

Similar to the manifest, we will use a builder interface to construct our component.

* Location

Specifies where the entry point where our component will be located.
We’ve chosen the sidebar location for this example, but there is a wide range of options that can be chosen depending on your use case.
For more information on the location field, visit the manifest’s components section.

* Access

Specifies the type of permission the user must have in order to access our component.
Supported values are admins, or everyone. We will be showing our add-on to every user of the workspace.
For more information on the access field, visit the manifest’s components section.

* Path

The path is a value relative to the base URL defined in the manifest.
A `GET` request will be made to this location every time the UI component is loaded in UI.

UI components are loaded inside iframes and will always be supplied with an authentication token query parameter, named as `auth_token`.
This token can be used to identify and authenticate the user who is viewing our component.
For more information on the component’s authentication, visit the [authentication](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html) section.

* Label

The label is a text field whose value will be shown on the component’s defined location - the sidebar in our case.
You can read more about the label under the manifest’s components section.

## Building our UI[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/quick-start)

To build our UI we will use the CAKE.com [Add-on UI kit](https://resources.developer.clockify.me/ui/latest/showcase/?path=/story/introduction--page).
Let’s start by creating an empty sidebar-component.html file under our resources folder.

* Import dependencies

Let's add the required imports for the Add-on UI kit.
For the purpose of this guide we will also be importing the [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) library which will be used to process time values.

```
1<html>
2   <head>
3       <link
4               rel="stylesheet"
5               href="https://resources.developer.clockify.me/ui/latest/css/main.min.css"
6       />
7       <script src="https://resources.developer.clockify.me/ui/latest/js/main.min.js"></script>
8       <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/date-fns@4.1.0/cdn.min.js"></script>
9   </head>
10</html>
```

* Define UI elements

Now that we’ve imported the UI kit, our next step is to create a body tag and then define our UI elements.

```
1<body>
2    <div class="tabs">
3       <div class="tabs-header">
4           <div class="tab-header active" data-tab="tab1">Time Reports</div>
5       </div>
6       <div class="tabs-content">
7           <div class="tab-content tab1 active">
8                <p>Your total tracked time is: <span id="tracked-time"></span></p>
9           </div>
10       </div>
11    </div>
12</body>
```

* Retrieving and decoding the authentication token

Our next goal will be to retrieve our time entries data through Clockify’s API and present a simple overview of the total time tracked.
The first thing that we need to do is to create a script section at the end of our file.

```
1<script>
2    
3</script>
```

Next, we’ll retrieve the authentication token that Clockify provides to our [component](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html) and use that token to make a call to the [Clockify API](https://docs.developer.clockify.me/).

```
1const token = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get('auth_token');
```

Clockify’s add-ons can be installed on a wide range of environments, be it on a regional instance or even on development test workspaces.

To ensure that add-ons can work independent of the environment where they are installed, we have to retrieve all the environment-related information from the authentication token - which is in fact a [JWT](https://jwt.io/).
You can learn more about the claims present in the JWT token on the following [link](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/introduction.html).

For our component, we’re mostly interested in the following three claims:

* backendUrl - the URL of the backend (environment) where our API calls will be made
* workspaceId - the ID of the workspace where our add-on was installed
* user - the ID of the user that is currently viewing our component

> It should be noted that each authentication token that is supplied to the iframe only references a specific add-on install on a single workspace.

> This example will bypass the verification step and only retrieve the claims from the token, but it’s ***strongly*** recommended that production add-ons perform the proper validations before accepting the token as valid.

> The JWT is signed with RSA256. The public key used to verify the token can be accessed on the following [link](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html).

```
1// note: JWT tokens and their respective claims should always be verified before being accepted
2const tokenPayload = JSON.parse(atob(token.split('.')[1]));
3const backendUrl = tokenPayload['backendUrl']
4const workspaceId = tokenPayload['workspaceId']
5const userId = tokenPayload['user']
```

* Interacting with the API

Now, it’s time to make the API call.

While Clockify provides endpoints for generating reports, to keep it simple we’re going to call the time entries endpoint which can be found [here](https://docs.developer.clockify.me/).

> Note that we're using the values we retrieved from the claims to construct the endpoint we're calling.

```
1const oneWeekAgo = dateFns.subWeeks(new Date(), 1)
2
3fetch(`${backendUrl}/v1/workspaces/${workspaceId}/user/${userId}/time-entries?` + new URLSearchParams({'page-size': 500, 'start': dateFns.formatISO(oneWeekAgo),}).toString(), {
4            headers: {"x-addon-token": token}, method: "GET"
5        }
6    ).then(response => {
7        if (response.status !== 200) {
8            console.log("Received status " + response.status)
9            return
10        }
11        
12        let totalDurationSeconds = 0;
13        response.json().forEach(entry => {
14            const start = entry["timeInterval"]["start"]
15            const end = entry["timeInterval"]["end"]
16
17            const durationSeconds = dateFns.differenceInSeconds(dateFns.parseISO(end), dateFns.parseISO(start))
18            totalDurationSeconds += durationSeconds;
19        });
20
21        const element = document.getElementById("tracked-time");
22        if (totalDurationSeconds !== 0) {
23            const duration = dateFns.intervalToDuration({ start: 0, end: totalDurationSeconds * 1000 })
24            element.textContent = dateFns.formatDuration(duration);
25        } else {
26            element.textContent = "no time tracked";
27        }
28        })
29    .catch(e => {console.log("Could not retrieve time entries")
30})
```

In the above snippet, we call the Clockify API and retrieve a list of time entries for our user.
Then, we iterate through the entries and sum up all the durations which will then be used to display the total duration in a human friendly way.

You will notice we supplied a header named `x-addon-token`. The token used to make this API call is the same token that was supplied at the moment our component was served.

This token has access only over the user that is currently viewing our UI component inside the Clockify iframe, and unlike the token that is supplied during the add-on install expires in 30 minutes.

## Serving our add-on[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/quick-start)

Now that our UI is ready, we need to go back to our Java class and set up the webserver for our add-on.

The Addon SDK provides an embedded web server which we can use to quickly set up and serve our manifest and the UI.

```
1var addon = new ClockifyAddon(manifest);
2addon.registerComponent(uiComponent, (request, response) -> {
3    var classLoader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
4    var inputStream = classLoader.getResourceAsStream("sidebar-component.html");
5    inputStream.transferTo(response.getOutputStream());
6    response.setStatus(HttpServletResponse.SC_OK);
7});
8
9var servlet = new AddonServlet(addon);
10var server = new EmbeddedServer(servlet);
11server.start(8080);
```

The manifest will be automatically served under the `/manifest` path, while for the UI we will register a handler which will load the HTML file from the resources and serve it to the response.

The UI component will be served under the path that was previously configured.

Our add-on is ready to be run, simply run the `main()` method and access the add-on manifest on `{baseUrl}/manifest` to install it on your development workspace.

## Testing our add-on[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/quick-start)

### Developer account[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/quick-start)

Now that we've got our add-on up and running we are ready to continue with the next step - trying out the add-on on the Clockify developer environment.

In order to do so, we first need to create a [developer account](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/developer-account.html).

### Testing environment[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/quick-start)

Once the account is set up, the next step is to access the testing environment for our account.
The testing environment is a pre-populated environment where you can test how your add-on would work in a real Clockify workspace.
Testing environments are unique to each developer account, and the created workspaces have access to all Clockify features.

To access the testing environment, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your [developer account](https://developer.marketplace.cake.com/)
2. Navigate to the ***Test accounts*** section and log in as one of the pre-made users
3. You’ll be redirected to the Clockify test environment
4. From there, go to ***Workspace settings***
5. Select the ***Add-ons*** tab (visible only to users with the administrator role)
6. Insert the link to your add-on manifest and click `Install`

A toast message will appear indicating a successful installation.
All the installed add-ons will be listed on this page.

> Multiple add-ons can be installed on testing environments as long as the manifest keys are unique among them.

The following info will be displayed on this page:

* Icon (if available, if not – default image)
* Name (from manifest)
* Status (enabled/disabled)
* Short description (from manifest)
* More options (listed if there are any)
* Settings (Optional and defined in manifest. If they exist, you can click on the Settings, and the Add-on settings page will open.)

`There are two types of settings:
Clockify settings – saved on our server and specified in manifest
Settings – add-on settings that can be done by developers and displayed as an iFrame on this page)`

* Enable/disable (Installed add-on is automatically enabled)
* Webhooks (opens a modal regarding add-on webhooks)
  Modal that opens displays webhooks that are sent from Clockify to this add-on.
* Uninstall (disabled add-on and removes it from the list)

> To maintain a secure environment and prevent potential misuse, your data will be automatically cleared every month.

### Providing a public URL[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/quick-start)

To be able to install our add-on, we first need to provide a public URL.
We can do so by using a reverse proxy service such as [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).
Let's create a free account at [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and follow their guidelines for installing & running app [docs](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/).

After you’ve setup ngrok, run the following command:

```
1ngrok http 8080
```

This will generate tunnel to your app running on port 8080.

Note the public URL in the output:

> <https://7ba8-188-246-34-133.eu.ngrok.io>

We can now go back to our add-on's code and provide this public URL as the base URL for our manifest.

### Installing our add-on[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/quick-start)

Once we've opened the add-ons tab on our workspace, we are ready to install our add-on.
With the add-on webserver running and our public URL configured, we'll paste in the link to our manifest `{base URL}/manifest` and click on install.

We can now see that our add-on has been successfully installed.
It will show up on the sidebar like in the screenshot below:

We can now click on our sidebar entry to access our add-on's UI.

> You may notice that our sidebar entry is using a default icon. You can specify a custom icon by setting the iconPath property on the UI component.

> You may observe the UI component has been loaded inside an iframe. UI components are always loaded inside iframes, irrespective of their location.

## Next steps[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/quick-start)

We've prepared a [Development Checklist](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/development-checklist.html) which will help you ensure that you've taken care of all the important aspects of the add-on development flow.

After you've gone through our development checklist, you are ready to check out our add-on [publishing section](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines.html) for a detailed overview of the add-on publishing flow.

# Clockify Add-on Quick Start Guide[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/quick-start.html)

## Developer account[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/quick-start.html)

Before starting our development process, we will need to create a CAKE.com developer account.
A developer account will allow us to publish, manage and monetize our add-ons as well as provide us with a testing environment and workspace where the add-on can be installed and tested during development.
You can learn more about how to get started with the developer account [here](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/developer-account.html).

## Let’s get started with developing a simple add-on.[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/quick-start.html)

In this guide we’ll build a new add-on from scratch and go through the development steps one by one, but first we have to define what an add-on is.

Add-ons are software components that can be used to extend the functionalities of CAKE.com products.
They are technology-agnostic, meaning they can be developed using the languages and frameworks of your choice.
For this guide we will be writing our add-on in Java, using the CAKE.com [Addon SDK](https://github.com/clockify/addon-java-sdk) and [UI Kit](https://resources.developer.clockify.me/ui/latest/showcase/?path=/story/introduction--page).

## Defining our add-on and its scope[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/quick-start.html)

Before starting our development process, we’ll need to define how our add-on will look like and what it aims to achieve.

For this guide, we will create a simple add-on which will add a new page to the Clockify's sidebar and will display a statistic of the time tracked by the current user.
As part of the guide we will implement and host a backend service and also integrate our add-on into Clockify’s UI.

## What to build[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/quick-start.html)

If you’re not sure what to build and what needs users have, you can check our
[roadmap](https://clockify.me/roadmap) and get ideas from suggested add-ons or feedback
[Forum](https://forum.clockify.me/) categories.

## Setting up a new project[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/quick-start.html)

We’ll start our development flow by creating a new project for our add-on. Let’s call it “Time Reports”.

1. We’ll create our first file named TimeReportsAddon.java, containing the following code:

```
1package com.cake.marketplace.examples.timereports;
2
3public class TimeReportsAddon {
4    public static void main(String[] args) {
5    }
6}
```

2. We’ll need to set up our Maven dependencies. This step consists of three parts:

* Configure and authenticate Github with maven as described in the following [page](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-apache-maven-registry).
* Configure our package repository in the ***pom.xml*** file by adding the following snippet:

`<repositories>
<repository>
<id>github</id>
<url>https://maven.pkg.github.com/clockify/addon-java-sdk</url>
</repository>
</repositories>`

* Configure our package dependency in the ***pom.xml*** file by adding the following snippet:

`<dependencies>
<dependency>
<groupId>com.cake.clockify</groupId>
<artifactId>addon-sdk</artifactId>
<version>1.4.0</version>
</dependency>
</dependencies>`

## Building our manifest[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/quick-start.html)

Now that we have successfully set up our project and dependencies we can start working on the add-on itself.
First, let's briefly explain what a manifest is.

A manifest is a file which describes an add-on and its functionalities.
Through the manifest you can define how your add-on integrates with CAKE.com products.

The format of the manifest file depends on the CAKE.com product your add-on is targeting, but in general will contain information about the add-on such as its identifier, name, permission scopes and other definitions that describe how it will interact with the product.
You can read more about the manifest, its syntax and various options on the [manifest](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/index.html) section of the documentation.

The Addon SDK provides a simple way to build and host our manifest file dynamically.
Let’s start by defining the manifest object, and then we’ll go over the details.

Our *main()* method will look like this:

```
1public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
2    var manifest = ClockifyManifest.v1_3Builder()
3        .key("time-reports-example")
4        .name("Time Reports")
5        .baseUrl("")
6        .requireFreePlan()
7        .description("Example add-on that displays time statistics")
8        .scopes(List.of(ClockifyScope.TIME_ENTRY_READ))
9        .build();
10}
```

Let’s go over the lines step by step.

* Builder interface

We'll start by using the builder interface to guide us through the steps needed to construct our manifest.
The manifest builder interface exposes one method for each supported schema version. In this guide we will use version 1.3 of the manifest schema.

* Key

The add-on key acts as an identifier for our add-on and must be a unique value among all add-ons published on the CAKE.com marketplace.

* Name

The add-on name is also a required field and must match the name under which the add-on gets published to the CAKE.com marketplace.
In the UI, the name will be displayed on Clockify's add-on settings tab.

* Base URL

The base URL is the URL that will act as the base location for our add-on. Other paths will be defined relative to this URL.
We're setting it to an empty value at this point as we do not yet have a publicly available URL we can use.

* Subscription plan

The minimal subscription plan is the minimum plan that Clockify workspaces must have in order to be able to install and use our add-on.
The `requireFreePlan()` method is a helper which sets the minimum required plan value to ‘FREE’.
Other supported values for the plan can be found on the manifest section.

* Description

The description field is an optional field, and can be populated with a short description of the add-on.
The text will be visible on Clockify's add-on settings tab.

* Scopes

Scopes are optional, but have to be defined if we intend to use certain features of the Clockify API.
For our example we need to request the `TIME_ENTRY_READ` scope since we will be making requests to the time entries endpoint.

## Building our UI component[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/quick-start.html)

Now that we've built the manifest object, the next step will be to define and serve our UI component.
Let's start by defining our component first, and then we'll get to the HTML part of the UI.

```
1var uiComponent = ClockifyComponent.builder()
2    .sidebar()
3    .allowEveryone()
4    .path("/sidebar-component")
5    .label("Time Reports")
6    .build();
```

In this guide we will be defining a single UI component which will be shown as a separate entry on the sidebar.

* Builder

Similar to the manifest, we will use a builder interface to construct our component.

* Location

Specifies where the entry point where our component will be located.
We’ve chosen the sidebar location for this example, but there is a wide range of options that can be chosen depending on your use case.
For more information on the location field, visit the manifest’s components section.

* Access

Specifies the type of permission the user must have in order to access our component.
Supported values are admins, or everyone. We will be showing our add-on to every user of the workspace.
For more information on the access field, visit the manifest’s components section.

* Path

The path is a value relative to the base URL defined in the manifest.
A `GET` request will be made to this location every time the UI component is loaded in UI.

UI components are loaded inside iframes and will always be supplied with an authentication token query parameter, named as `auth_token`.
This token can be used to identify and authenticate the user who is viewing our component.
For more information on the component’s authentication, visit the [authentication](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html) section.

* Label

The label is a text field whose value will be shown on the component’s defined location - the sidebar in our case.
You can read more about the label under the manifest’s components section.

## Building our UI[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/quick-start.html)

To build our UI we will use the CAKE.com [Add-on UI kit](https://resources.developer.clockify.me/ui/latest/showcase/?path=/story/introduction--page).
Let’s start by creating an empty sidebar-component.html file under our resources folder.

* Import dependencies

Let's add the required imports for the Add-on UI kit.
For the purpose of this guide we will also be importing the [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) library which will be used to process time values.

```
1<html>
2   <head>
3       <link
4               rel="stylesheet"
5               href="https://resources.developer.clockify.me/ui/latest/css/main.min.css"
6       />
7       <script src="https://resources.developer.clockify.me/ui/latest/js/main.min.js"></script>
8       <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/date-fns@4.1.0/cdn.min.js"></script>
9   </head>
10</html>
```

* Define UI elements

Now that we’ve imported the UI kit, our next step is to create a body tag and then define our UI elements.

```
1<body>
2    <div class="tabs">
3       <div class="tabs-header">
4           <div class="tab-header active" data-tab="tab1">Time Reports</div>
5       </div>
6       <div class="tabs-content">
7           <div class="tab-content tab1 active">
8                <p>Your total tracked time is: <span id="tracked-time"></span></p>
9           </div>
10       </div>
11    </div>
12</body>
```

* Retrieving and decoding the authentication token

Our next goal will be to retrieve our time entries data through Clockify’s API and present a simple overview of the total time tracked.
The first thing that we need to do is to create a script section at the end of our file.

```
1<script>
2    
3</script>
```

Next, we’ll retrieve the authentication token that Clockify provides to our [component](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html) and use that token to make a call to the [Clockify API](https://docs.developer.clockify.me/).

```
1const token = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get('auth_token');
```

Clockify’s add-ons can be installed on a wide range of environments, be it on a regional instance or even on development test workspaces.

To ensure that add-ons can work independent of the environment where they are installed, we have to retrieve all the environment-related information from the authentication token - which is in fact a [JWT](https://jwt.io/).
You can learn more about the claims present in the JWT token on the following [link](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/introduction.html).

For our component, we’re mostly interested in the following three claims:

* backendUrl - the URL of the backend (environment) where our API calls will be made
* workspaceId - the ID of the workspace where our add-on was installed
* user - the ID of the user that is currently viewing our component

> It should be noted that each authentication token that is supplied to the iframe only references a specific add-on install on a single workspace.

> This example will bypass the verification step and only retrieve the claims from the token, but it’s ***strongly*** recommended that production add-ons perform the proper validations before accepting the token as valid.

> The JWT is signed with RSA256. The public key used to verify the token can be accessed on the following [link](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html).

```
1// note: JWT tokens and their respective claims should always be verified before being accepted
2const tokenPayload = JSON.parse(atob(token.split('.')[1]));
3const backendUrl = tokenPayload['backendUrl']
4const workspaceId = tokenPayload['workspaceId']
5const userId = tokenPayload['user']
```

* Interacting with the API

Now, it’s time to make the API call.

While Clockify provides endpoints for generating reports, to keep it simple we’re going to call the time entries endpoint which can be found [here](https://docs.developer.clockify.me/).

> Note that we're using the values we retrieved from the claims to construct the endpoint we're calling.

```
1const oneWeekAgo = dateFns.subWeeks(new Date(), 1)
2
3fetch(`${backendUrl}/v1/workspaces/${workspaceId}/user/${userId}/time-entries?` + new URLSearchParams({'page-size': 500, 'start': dateFns.formatISO(oneWeekAgo),}).toString(), {
4            headers: {"x-addon-token": token}, method: "GET"
5        }
6    ).then(response => {
7        if (response.status !== 200) {
8            console.log("Received status " + response.status)
9            return
10        }
11        
12        let totalDurationSeconds = 0;
13        response.json().forEach(entry => {
14            const start = entry["timeInterval"]["start"]
15            const end = entry["timeInterval"]["end"]
16
17            const durationSeconds = dateFns.differenceInSeconds(dateFns.parseISO(end), dateFns.parseISO(start))
18            totalDurationSeconds += durationSeconds;
19        });
20
21        const element = document.getElementById("tracked-time");
22        if (totalDurationSeconds !== 0) {
23            const duration = dateFns.intervalToDuration({ start: 0, end: totalDurationSeconds * 1000 })
24            element.textContent = dateFns.formatDuration(duration);
25        } else {
26            element.textContent = "no time tracked";
27        }
28        })
29    .catch(e => {console.log("Could not retrieve time entries")
30})
```

In the above snippet, we call the Clockify API and retrieve a list of time entries for our user.
Then, we iterate through the entries and sum up all the durations which will then be used to display the total duration in a human friendly way.

You will notice we supplied a header named `x-addon-token`. The token used to make this API call is the same token that was supplied at the moment our component was served.

This token has access only over the user that is currently viewing our UI component inside the Clockify iframe, and unlike the token that is supplied during the add-on install expires in 30 minutes.

## Serving our add-on[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/quick-start.html)

Now that our UI is ready, we need to go back to our Java class and set up the webserver for our add-on.

The Addon SDK provides an embedded web server which we can use to quickly set up and serve our manifest and the UI.

```
1var addon = new ClockifyAddon(manifest);
2addon.registerComponent(uiComponent, (request, response) -> {
3    var classLoader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
4    var inputStream = classLoader.getResourceAsStream("sidebar-component.html");
5    inputStream.transferTo(response.getOutputStream());
6    response.setStatus(HttpServletResponse.SC_OK);
7});
8
9var servlet = new AddonServlet(addon);
10var server = new EmbeddedServer(servlet);
11server.start(8080);
```

The manifest will be automatically served under the `/manifest` path, while for the UI we will register a handler which will load the HTML file from the resources and serve it to the response.

The UI component will be served under the path that was previously configured.

Our add-on is ready to be run, simply run the `main()` method and access the add-on manifest on `{baseUrl}/manifest` to install it on your development workspace.

## Testing our add-on[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/quick-start.html)

### Developer account[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/quick-start.html)

Now that we've got our add-on up and running we are ready to continue with the next step - trying out the add-on on the Clockify developer environment.

In order to do so, we first need to create a [developer account](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/developer-account.html).

### Testing environment[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/quick-start.html)

Once the account is set up, the next step is to access the testing environment for our account.
The testing environment is a pre-populated environment where you can test how your add-on would work in a real Clockify workspace.
Testing environments are unique to each developer account, and the created workspaces have access to all Clockify features.

To access the testing environment, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your [developer account](https://developer.marketplace.cake.com/)
2. Navigate to the ***Test accounts*** section and log in as one of the pre-made users
3. You’ll be redirected to the Clockify test environment
4. From there, go to ***Workspace settings***
5. Select the ***Add-ons*** tab (visible only to users with the administrator role)
6. Insert the link to your add-on manifest and click `Install`

A toast message will appear indicating a successful installation.
All the installed add-ons will be listed on this page.

> Multiple add-ons can be installed on testing environments as long as the manifest keys are unique among them.

The following info will be displayed on this page:

* Icon (if available, if not – default image)
* Name (from manifest)
* Status (enabled/disabled)
* Short description (from manifest)
* More options (listed if there are any)
* Settings (Optional and defined in manifest. If they exist, you can click on the Settings, and the Add-on settings page will open.)

`There are two types of settings:
Clockify settings – saved on our server and specified in manifest
Settings – add-on settings that can be done by developers and displayed as an iFrame on this page)`

* Enable/disable (Installed add-on is automatically enabled)
* Webhooks (opens a modal regarding add-on webhooks)
  Modal that opens displays webhooks that are sent from Clockify to this add-on.
* Uninstall (disabled add-on and removes it from the list)

> To maintain a secure environment and prevent potential misuse, your data will be automatically cleared every month.

### Providing a public URL[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/quick-start.html)

To be able to install our add-on, we first need to provide a public URL.
We can do so by using a reverse proxy service such as [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).
Let's create a free account at [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and follow their guidelines for installing & running app [docs](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/).

After you’ve setup ngrok, run the following command:

```
1ngrok http 8080
```

This will generate tunnel to your app running on port 8080.

Note the public URL in the output:

> <https://7ba8-188-246-34-133.eu.ngrok.io>

We can now go back to our add-on's code and provide this public URL as the base URL for our manifest.

### Installing our add-on[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/quick-start.html)

Once we've opened the add-ons tab on our workspace, we are ready to install our add-on.
With the add-on webserver running and our public URL configured, we'll paste in the link to our manifest `{base URL}/manifest` and click on install.

We can now see that our add-on has been successfully installed.
It will show up on the sidebar like in the screenshot below:

We can now click on our sidebar entry to access our add-on's UI.

> You may notice that our sidebar entry is using a default icon. You can specify a custom icon by setting the iconPath property on the UI component.

> You may observe the UI component has been loaded inside an iframe. UI components are always loaded inside iframes, irrespective of their location.

## Next steps[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/quick-start.html)

We've prepared a [Development Checklist](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/development-checklist.html) which will help you ensure that you've taken care of all the important aspects of the add-on development flow.

After you've gone through our development checklist, you are ready to check out our add-on [publishing section](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines.html) for a detailed overview of the add-on publishing flow.

# Development Checklist[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/development-checklist.html)

The following is a checklist that will help you go through the most important aspects that need to be accounted for when developing an add-on.

| Checklist | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Configurations](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/development-checklist.html) | Ensure add-on is properly configured for the production environment |
| [Loading time](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/development-checklist.html) | Ensure your UI components are loaded without unnecessary delays |

| [User preferences and UX](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/development-checklist.html) | Ensure the UX of the add-on matches with the user's preferences on Clockify |

## Environment[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/development-checklist.html)

### Configurations[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/development-checklist.html)

You must ensure that the release version of your add-on is configured properly for the production environment.
Things that need to be checked include but are not limited to:

* the manifest data
* the public base URL in case you have multiple environments for you add-on (ex: development and production)
* external configurations like database connections and API keys for external services
* registered UI components
* Clockify endpoint URLs

In most cases an add-on will have multiple environments and generate its manifest dynamically, with the base URL property being specified as an external configuration property.

Clockify endpoint URLs are always dependent on the environment in which the add-on is installed.
You can learn more about Clockify environments on the [environments and regions](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/environments-and-regions.html) page.

> You **must** ensure your production add-on does not contain hardcoded values like URLs, IDs or tokens which can break its functionality and make it vulnerable to security attacks.

### Loading time[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/development-checklist.html)

To provide a seamless integration for your users, you must ensure that the UI components for your add-on are loaded in a timely manner.
This includes but is not limited to:

* only serving assets that are required for the add-on to function
* compressing and serving media assets in sensible sizes
* serving minified versions of static assets (JS and CSS)

## Security[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/development-checklist.html)

### Token Verification[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/development-checklist.html)

You should verify the signatures of every token that the add-on receives before accepting it as valid.
All tokens that are signed by Clockify will be JWT tokens signed with RSA256. You can read more about the verification on
the [Authentication & Authorization section](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html).

The following is a checklist of items that should be checked when verifying a token:

* [token signature is verified](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html)
* token algorithm is `RS256`
* `iss` claim is 'clockify'
* `type` claim is 'addon'
* `sub` claim matches with the addon manifest key
* token is not expired

Additionally, a token might be valid, but it might not be signed on behalf of the expected workspace.
For instance, a token that is signed on behalf of an add-on on workspace A might be used to gain access to resources belonging to workspace B.

You should use the following claims to verify that a request matches the specific workspace for which it was intended:

`addonId - the ID of the installation on the workspace
workspaceId - the ID of the workspace`

### [Token types](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html)[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/development-checklist.html)

You should ensure the correct token type is used depending on the needs. Generally you should aim to use the token with the least access, which is the user token, wherever possible.

User tokens can be used both on the backend and frontend parts of an add-on. Installation tokens should never be used on the frontend.

### [Installation token](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html)[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/development-checklist.html)

As described on the [Authentication & Authorization section](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html), the installation token is a type of token that has full access over a workspace
and ***does not expire***.

Due to the sensitive nature of its scope and the fact that it does not expire, care should be taken ***not to leak*** the installation token to an end user, to the UI of the add-on or to a third
party.

> The installation token should never be logged. If present in request headers, you should ensure that it's properly redacted.

### Webhooks verification[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/development-checklist.html)

You should verify the signatures of every webhook event you receive before accepting it as valid.
You can read more on how to verify the signature of a webhook on the [webhooks section](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/webhooks.html).
It is also recommended that you validate information from the payload against the claims of the provided token.

> For example, you should ensure the workspace ID referenced in the payload of a time off request matches with the workspace ID that is part of the token claims.

### Lifecycle verification[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/development-checklist.html)

Similar to [webhooks](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/development-checklist.html), lifecycle signatures must also be verified before being accepted as valid. You can read more about the verification on
the [Authentication & Authorization section](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html).

## Add-on behavior[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/development-checklist.html)

### Testing on multiple environments[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/development-checklist.html)

You must ensure your add-on works as expected on [different environments](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/environments-and-regions.html) and workspaces.
The CAKE.com [Developer Portal](https://developer.marketplace.cake.com/) provides access to pre-populated [testing environments](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/learn/quick-start.html) where you can test how your add-on
behaves.
We recommend that you thoroughly test your add-on's behavior on multiple workspaces (by creating multiple developer accounts) and with multiple users and access levels (each testing environment allows
you to log in on behalf of various pre-existing users).

> You **must** ensure that your add-on does not leak data to unauthorised workspaces or users.

### Lifecycle[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/development-checklist.html)

* install - it is recommended that you [persist the installation payload](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/manifest/lifecycle.html) as the `installed` event will only be dispatched once per installation
* uninstall - it is recommended that your add-on takes care to properly handle uninstall events, including: removing database entries, cancelling scheduled jobs, invalidating tokens etc

### Webhooks[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/development-checklist.html)

All webhook events contain a signature under the `clockify-signature` header.
This signature must match with the corresponding add-on installation.
Additionally, the `clockify-webhook-event-type` header must also match with the expected webhook event.

***Timeout***

You should aim to respond to webhook events in a timely manner.
If you must execute a long-running operation that is triggered by a webhook event, you should schedule it to be executed asynchronously and avoid blocking the request.

## Add-on UX[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/development-checklist.html)

Add-ons should support the configurations and the preferences set by the user on Clockify.

These include but are not limited to:

* theme (light/dark)
* language
* date and time formats
* timezone and location
* currency settings

Some of the above can be retrieved from the token claims present in the [user token](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html).

[Claims present](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html) in the user token are:

* `language`
* `theme`

Information about the other properties can be retrieved by making an [authenticated API request](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/build/authentication-and-authorization.html) to
the [Clockify API](https://docs.clockify.me/).

# Private Add-ons Documentation[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/private-addon-deployment.html)

## Introduction to Private Add-ons[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/private-addon-deployment.html)

Private add-ons allow developers to create solutions accessible only to specific workspaces, ideal for internal testing and use. This feature encourages users with custom integrations to transition to managed add-ons, enhancing security.

## Creating a Private Add-on[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/private-addon-deployment.html)

### Steps to Create:[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/private-addon-deployment.html)

1. **Set Visibility**: Set Visibility: During creation, select "Private" visibility.
2. **Whitelist Workspaces**: Define up to three workspaces by their IDs for access.
3. **Manifest key**: If you already have the add-on in production, the manifest key needs to be different since the private add-on is technically a new add-on.

> **Note**: You can find your workspace ID by going to the workspace settings.

## Managing a Private Add-on[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/private-addon-deployment.html)

### Updating Versions[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/private-addon-deployment.html)

* Maintain whitelists across versions unless changes are needed.
* Upon removing a workspace from whitelists, the add-on is automatically uninstalled.
* When a new workspace is added, an email is sent notifying the user about the add-on.

## Publishing a Private Add-on[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/private-addon-deployment.html)

### Key Differences:[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/private-addon-deployment.html)

* **No Payment Setup**: Skip payment configuration.
* **No Vendor Profile**: Not required for private distribution.
* **No Review Process**: Immediate publication post-submission.
* **Can delete a Private Add-on without waiting.**

### Deleting a Private Add-on:[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/private-addon-deployment.html)

* Deletion is immediate. All installations are removed upon deletion.

## Installing a Private Add-on[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/private-addon-deployment.html)

### Admin Instructions:[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/private-addon-deployment.html)

1. **Receive URL**: Obtain installation link via email notification.
2. **Install**: Use provided URL to install the add-on.
3. **Visibility**: See "Private" status in Clockify, distinguishing from public versions.

# Publishing[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines)

## Guidelines & best practices[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines)

### What’s the criteria add-ons need to meet in order to be published?[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines)

We want to make sure that every individual using any CAKE.com Marketplace add-on gets a product that is useful, has high performance and uses their data responsibly.
That’s why we’ve compiled a set of instructions and guidelines that can help you build the add-on that meets these standards. Prior to building, please, take a couple of minutes and read through these to make sure that the add-on you want to build complies with the requirements listed below.

### What are general guidelines for add-on content?[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines)

***Become familiar with the system.***

Clockify is a complex system consisting of many components with all sorts of dependencies between them: Timesheet, Timetracker, Calendar, Report, Project, etc. They all work together and complement each other perfectly. That’s why, it’s important you’re familiar with all the entities and patterns that Clockify comprises, so that you can use them in a way that Clockify’s customers are familiar with.

To better understand elements used to build Clockify, check out Clockify’s [Glossary of terms](https://clockify.me/help/getting-started/clockify_basics/clockify-glossary).

***Strive to enhance customer experience.***

If you’re already our customer, you can start building an app that will benefit you and your team, solve your problems and later share it with everyone else.
If you’ve never used our product, we recommend you create [a free account](https://app.clockify.me/en/login). Try to build something new and unique.

***Be clear about the purpose.***

Sharing data with a third party can be scary for some users. Therefore, you should be clear on how what you built adds value to their customer experience and state clearly what their data will (and won’t) be used for.

***Don’t mislead your users.***

Make sure you clearly stated add-on’s purpose and necessary details when creating your first version. You should also provide clear descriptions, screenshots and videos in order to describe your add-on accurately.

***Explore our branding guidelines.***

Since an add-on you’re building will be part of an existing product, we suggest you take a look at our [product branding guidelines](https://www.figma.com/@cake_dot_com) and check if the assets you built follow these guidelines before you submit an add-on for a review.

***Make an easy setup.***

More people are likely to use an add-on that’s easy to set up. This is one of the crucial characteristics that attracts new users.
For instance, if using your product requires an account, it should be created by getting the credentials from Clockify. If you need to ask customers to sign up manually, you should pre-fill some user information, e.g. user email.

***Inform user of a third-party account.***

If, in order to use add-on, user needs to create a separate third-party account (i.e. log in to another service), this must be stated clearly to the user in the description and the overview of the add-on.

***Check grammar and spelling.***

Add-on should not contain any typos, or grammatical errors. Therefore, check grammar and spelling prior to submitting it for a review.

### Is there any type of content that is prohibited?[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines)

To ensure that CAKE.com Marketplace is a safe platform, we’ve created standards that define and prohibit content that is harmful, inappropriate or offensive to others.

***Hate speech.***

Add-ons that promote violence, or incite hatred against individuals, or a group of individuals based on race, ethnicity, religion, age, disability, nationality, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or any other characteristic associated with discrimination will not be published.

***Violence.***

We don’t allow add-ons that facilitate or promote violence or endangerment of an individual’s safety.

***Bullying and harassment.***

Add-ons that contain or encourage threats, harassment and bullying will not be published.

***Harmful and malicious products.***

Add-ons that promote or support any type of harmful and malicious products won’t be published.

### Final note[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines)

Keep in mind that assets that contain any type of prohibited content will not be published. Also, any prohibited, or harmful content that is added after reviewing and publishing, and reported by users, will be removed from the marketplace immediately.
Please note that these guidelines should be used in addition to our [Terms of Use](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/terms.html), [Privacy Policy](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/privacy.html), [Security Requirements](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines) and [Listing Agreement](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/cake-com-marketplace-listing-agreement.html). Be sure to read all of these documents.
Also, keep in mind that these guidelines evolve along with our business. Feel free to get in touch if you have any feedback, or suggestions.

## Create add-on[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines)

### How to create add-on?[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines)

You’ll have complete independence and autonomy over building your add-on. This means that you’ll build it locally, but before submitting your code for a review, you should test it in the testing environment provided to you. Also, check out our [REST API documentation](https://docs.developer.clockify.me/) and Development Toolkit section to get a better insight on how to build and maintain add-ons. Add-on then needs to be approved by our developers in the reviewing process and then it can be published.  
To make sure the whole process goes smoothly and your request is approved shortly, we will provide you with the necessary requirements and standards all CAKE.com add-ons should meet in order to be published.

> When creating an add-on you’re actually creating the first version of your add-on. All subsequent iterations will be defined as versions in the Marketplace (e.g. v 1.0.1).

To create add-on:

1. Log in or sign up for your [developer account](https://developer.marketplace.cake.com/)
2. Go to ***Add-ons*** page
3. Click ***CREATE ADD-ON***

Now, complete a two-step process and enter the required data.

1. Basic information

* ***Add-on icon***: Upload image
* ***Add-on name***: Choose a descriptive name that users can easily understand
* ***Add-on manifest***: Enter URL
* ***Product***: Refers to the application for which you are creating add-on

At the moment, you can only choose Clockify. You’ll be able to create add-ons for Pumble and Plaky soon.

* ***Visibility***: Public – Add-on is visible to everyone and allows users within the CAKE.com community to share it.

At the moment, add-ons can only be public. Private add-ons are coming soon.

* ***Pricing model***: Define pricing model for your add-on.

`Free
Paid`

Click ***NEXT*** to proceed to the second step of the form.

> You can always save the form as draft and edit it later.

2. Listing

Information you add in the listing will be available in the Marketplace. Use it to help drive users to your add-on.

* ***Choose category***: Define a niche or business sector you’d like to improve by building this add-on. In the Marketplace, published add-on will be placed in the category you selected here.
* ***Short description***: Give a short overview of the purpose of your add-on and solution it provides
* ***Long description***: Explain what your add-on is providing in greater detail and the value it brings to users
* ***Privacy policy***: Define privacy policy and clearly disclose which information you’re collecting in this manner
* ***Terms of use*** (optional): Along with privacy policy, you can also add terms of use users need to agree to, in order to proceed with installation

> Please keep in mind that, if there are some contradictory statements in terms of use you provided here, to those written by our legal team, CAKE.com’s legal policy should be followed.

* ***Website*** (optional): Add a link to the website that contains more information about add-on. Creating a website that promotes your add-on can help you attract more users.
* ***Add-on gallery*** (optional): Upload a set of images, or screenshots that reflect the purpose and promote your add-on in the best way. You can upload up to 5 images.
* ***Demo video*** (optional): Add demo to spread the word, boost traffic, or use it as an instructional video. Video needs to be publicly accessible on YouTube.

We encourage you to provide some additional instructions, including information that would be relevant to the person doing an add-on review like some additional notes or any other kind of specific guidelines.

Finally, by checking the Marketplace Listing Terms box you agree that you’ll meet and oblige the [listing terms](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/cake-com-marketplace-listing-agreement.html) stated there as long as your add-on is part of the CAKE.com Marketplace.

Information provided in this step will be published and available along with the add-on on the [Marketplace website](https://marketplace.cake.com/).

> Information provided in the two-step forms above, must be written in English.

After you’ve completed the two steps, click the ***SUBMIT FOR REVIEW*** button and your add-on will be submitted to the CAKE.com Marketplace team for a review.

> Once you’ve submitted your add-on for a review, our team will start the reviewing process soon as possible.

### How does reviewing work?[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines)

> In order to successfully submit your add-on version for a review, all the fields need to be filled out correctly and there should be no pending requests.

Once you click the ***SUBMIT FOR REVIEW*** button, a new add-on version request will be created. Request will get a pending status and will be sent to our team for a review. You will get an email that confirms you have successfully submitted a request for new version.

> Reviewing process will take approximately two weeks.

When it’s done, you will receive an email informing you that your request is approved, or denied. The request will also be appropriately marked as approved or denied in your profile.

If denied, we’ll send you the feedback notes from our team that could help you understand why the request was denied. You’ll also be able to see the request, edit it based on the feedback you received and submit it for a review again.

If approved, you can continue and publish the version directly from the email you received, by clicking ***PUBLISH***. You’ll receive another confirmation email that will inform you that your add-on is published and available in the marketplace. Click ***View [addonname]*** to see it in the marketplace.

## Create version & publish[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines)

### How to create new version?[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines)

Every created add-on must have a version. Versioning add-ons helps you create and improve add-on’s functionality easily and gradually without causing inconvenience to your users.

In order to create a new version, at least one version of an add-on needs to be published. Learn more about how to create add-on’s first version on Create Add-on section above.

First version will be automatically created as version 1.0.0. For each new request, you need to manually add the version number. Version number should reflect complexity of the functionalities with major version being marked as e.g. 1.1.0 and minor version as e.g. 1.0.1. Also, keep in mind that version numbers should be marked in a logical progression, e.g. 2.0.0 version cannot be followed by version 1.5.0.

Creating new version is a three-step process similar to the one used to create an add-on.
However, when creating new version, add-on name and icon in the Basic information page are generated from the published version, but can be edited. Steps two and three are the same.

### Which status can version request have?[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines)

Based on its lifecycle stage, status of add-on’s version request can be:

* Draft

Version request is in draft if you haven’t completed all the steps when creating an add-on, but you saved information you entered by clicking the Save as draft button.

* Pending

When you submit the version for a review, its status is updated to Pending. After review, the version can be approved or declined with status changing accordingly.

> There can be only one pending request per add-on.

* Declined

After your version is reviewed, it can be approved or declined. If your version is declined, along with that information, you will also get an explanation on why. You can edit the declined version based on this feedback and submit it for a review again.

* Approved

An approved version is approved by our team. It goes further into the publishing cycle and is ready to be published.

* Published

This is the final step in the publishing cycle. Once the version is approved, it can be published and when published it becomes available in the marketplace for everyone to use.
After you published one add-on version, you can proceed by creating a new one.

Once your add-on (first, or any subsequent version) has been published on the CAKE.com Marketplace, you’ll receive a confirmation email saying that your add-on version has been successfully published.

> Add-on can have only one published version.

If an add-on is already in the marketplace, once its new version request is published, the existing published version immediately becomes outdated.

* Outdated

If a newer version is published, the existing one becomes automatically deprecated and outdated.

* Unlisted

This status is added to the published version that has been removed from the marketplace and can’t be used or installed by new users. However, those who use the unlisted version can still see and use it.

## Delete add-on[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines)

You can delete an entire add-on with all of its versions regardless of their status, or just an add-on’s version request. You can do both of these actions from the Add-ons page, in your profile. However, deleting an entire add-on requires sending a request to our support team.

### How to delete add-on?[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines)

If you’d like to delete your add-on, you can do that from the ***Add-ons*** page.

To delete an add-on:

1. Click ***Delete add-on*** in the bottom right corner
2. Delete add-on modal appears
3. Click ***SEND REQUEST***

After you’ve sent the request to delete an add-on, our support team will contact you shortly, and ask for confirmation. Soon after your confirmation, the process of deletion will start. Add-on users will receive an email that informs them of deletion and you will receive an email that notifies you that the process has begun.

Once the process has started, add-on is unlisted, removed from the marketplace and unavailable for new users. The existing users will be able to use the add-on until it is deleted. To ensure that they are informed, after the deletion process is set in motion, information of the deletion and add-on’s retirement date will be prominently displayed at the top of the page throughout the application.

> The process of deletion lasts 31 days. An add-on will be deleted at the end of the last day at midnight. This process cannot be canceled or reversed.

After it is deleted:

* Add-on will be deleted from the marketplace
* Your profile and all users will lose access to it
* Subscription will be canceled for paid add-ons

### How to delete add-on version request?[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines)

If you don’t want to continue with the process of creating a new add-on version, you can delete it in the request preview table, in the ***Add-ons*** page.

When deleting an add-on version, depending on the status of the version, different actions are available.

If version is in:

* Draft

If this is the only version request for this add-on, by deleting it, you will delete an entire add-on and if not, you will delete only draft version of this add-on.

* Pending

If this is the only version request for this add-on, by deleting it, you will delete an entire add-on and if not, you will delete only draft version of this add-on.

* Approved

If this is the only version request for this add-on, by deleting it, you will delete an entire add-on and if not, you will delete only draft version of this add-on.

* Declined

If this is the only version request for this add-on, by deleting it, you will delete an entire add-on and if not, you will delete only draft version of this add-on.

* Outdated

If this is the only version request for this add-on, by deleting it, you will delete an entire add-on and if not, you will delete only draft version of this add-on.

> You cannot delete the Unlisted and Published add-on versions since that action would affect potential users of those add-ons.

## Data privacy guidelines[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines)

As you’ll have access to customer information which includes personal data, it’s important how you store and handle the data. Personal data is sensitive and in many cases regulated by applicable laws. Listed below are best practices you should follow, in addition to the [Terms of Use](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/terms.html), when developing the add-on on the CAKE.com marketplace.

### Clearly explain your data privacy practices[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines)

When submitting your add-on for review you are required to provide a Privacy policy which should explain to the users how you plan on using their data. The privacy policy should clearly explain to the user what data the add-on will collect, how that data will be used, who will have access to the data and explain the user’s choice.

### Minimize the data you collect[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines)

Collect data only where you need it. Do not collect the data because you think it may be useful later. Where personal data is involved, consider de-identifying it. Also consider deleting user data when they request it or when they uninstall your add-on. Have in mind that you don’t need to store data indefinitely, put some data retention schemes in place.

### Get consent for certain data use[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines)

When submitting an add-on for review you’ll have to check which data you collect in the permissions tab. You should only collect the data you checked in that tab. In this way users consent to the usage of their data when installing an add-on, but only for the purpose of an add-on. Using data for marketing, sharing data with third-parties and other data use cases not strictly required to support the operation of your add-on may require a separate consent from the user before collecting or using the data. As a general rule of thumb, you should always get consent if the user would not expect their data to be used or shared in a particular way given the purpose of your add-on.

Consent may not be embedded in a privacy policy. Instead, it must be collected from the user directly. You are responsible for collecting and maintaining all such consents, either through the add-on itself or through direct communication with the add-on user.

Note, regardless of whether you obtain consent, some data use cases may be prohibited by the [Terms of Use](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/terms.html). You are responsible for reviewing and complying with those terms.

### Provide access, modification and erasure of personal data[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines)

Applicable laws and data management best practices require that you make it easy for users to get a copy of, correct and delete their personal data. This means, if you are storing personal data, you need to know where that personal data is at all times and be able to update it or remove it upon request.

### Offer additional data processing terms[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines)

If you are accessing, storing or otherwise processing personal data of EEA residents, users may request that you sign and comply with additional data protection terms, consistent with Article 28 of the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). You are responsible for understanding and complying with the terms required under Article 28 of the GDPR as it relates to the user data you access, store or otherwise process in connection with the user’s consent to install and share data with your add-on.

### Invest in data security[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines)

You must take reasonable steps to protect user data shared with you and collected by your add-on, including user device information. We recommend you to follow our Security guidelines for a more comprehensive list for securing your add-on.

In the event your add-on or suppliers experience a data security breach, you are responsible for communicating with users and regulators, as required by applicable law. It’s also important to let us know of the incident by emailing to [support@cake.com](mailto:support@cake.com).

## Security requirements[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines)

### Authentication & authorization[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines)

An add-on must authenticate and authorize every request on all endpoints exposed. Anonymous access to application endpoints and resources can be allowed in scenarios where it is needed.

### Data protection[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines)

1. Any CAKE.com End User Data stored by an application outside of the CAKE.com product or users’ browser must ensure full disk encryption at-rest. If accessed by an application or a service, it should be authenticated and authorized appropriately.
2. An application must use TLS version 1.2 (or higher) to encrypt all of its traffic, and enable HSTS with a minimum age of one year.
3. An application must follow the “Principle of Least Privilege”, when requesting app scopes. This means that an application should only request scopes required to perform its intended functionality, and nothing more.
4. An application must securely store and manage secrets, which include OAuth tokens, sharedSecret, API keys, and encryption keys. They cannot be stored in places that are easily accessible. Examples of places include:

* Source code and code repository tools, such as Bitbucket and Github
* URL strings
* Referer headers
* Application logs

### Application security[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines)

1. An application must maintain and securely configure domains where the application is hosted.
2. When applicable, an application must enable security headers and cookie security attributes.
3. An application must validate and sanitize all untrusted data and treat all user input as unsafe to mitigate injection-related vulnerabilities. Untrusted data is any input that can be manipulated to contain a web attack payload.
4. An application must not use versions of third-party libraries and dependencies with known critical or high vulnerabilities. When vulnerabilities in these libraries and dependencies are discovered, application developers must remediate them as quickly as possible.

### Privacy[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines)

1. An application must not collect or store credentials belonging to CAKE.com user accounts such as user passwords or user API tokens.

### Vulnerability management[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines)

1. You must notify CAKE.com of all security incidents via [support@cake.com](mailto:support@cake.com).
2. Your account email will be taken as a security contact where you’ll be notified about vulnerabilities in the app.

## Guidelines & best practices[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines.html)

### What’s the criteria add-ons need to meet in order to be published?[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines.html)

We want to make sure that every individual using any CAKE.com Marketplace add-on gets a product that is useful, has high performance and uses their data responsibly.
That’s why we’ve compiled a set of instructions and guidelines that can help you build the add-on that meets these standards. Prior to building, please, take a couple of minutes and read through these to make sure that the add-on you want to build complies with the requirements listed below.

### What are general guidelines for add-on content?[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines.html)

***Become familiar with the system.***

Clockify is a complex system consisting of many components with all sorts of dependencies between them: Timesheet, Timetracker, Calendar, Report, Project, etc. They all work together and complement each other perfectly. That’s why, it’s important you’re familiar with all the entities and patterns that Clockify comprises, so that you can use them in a way that Clockify’s customers are familiar with.

To better understand elements used to build Clockify, check out Clockify’s [Glossary of terms](https://clockify.me/help/getting-started/clockify_basics/clockify-glossary).

***Strive to enhance customer experience.***

If you’re already our customer, you can start building an app that will benefit you and your team, solve your problems and later share it with everyone else.
If you’ve never used our product, we recommend you create [a free account](https://app.clockify.me/en/login). Try to build something new and unique.

***Be clear about the purpose.***

Sharing data with a third party can be scary for some users. Therefore, you should be clear on how what you built adds value to their customer experience and state clearly what their data will (and won’t) be used for.

***Don’t mislead your users.***

Make sure you clearly stated add-on’s purpose and necessary details when creating your first version. You should also provide clear descriptions, screenshots and videos in order to describe your add-on accurately.

***Explore our branding guidelines.***

Since an add-on you’re building will be part of an existing product, we suggest you take a look at our [product branding guidelines](https://www.figma.com/@cake_dot_com) and check if the assets you built follow these guidelines before you submit an add-on for a review.

***Make an easy setup.***

More people are likely to use an add-on that’s easy to set up. This is one of the crucial characteristics that attracts new users.
For instance, if using your product requires an account, it should be created by getting the credentials from Clockify. If you need to ask customers to sign up manually, you should pre-fill some user information, e.g. user email.

***Inform user of a third-party account.***

If, in order to use add-on, user needs to create a separate third-party account (i.e. log in to another service), this must be stated clearly to the user in the description and the overview of the add-on.

***Check grammar and spelling.***

Add-on should not contain any typos, or grammatical errors. Therefore, check grammar and spelling prior to submitting it for a review.

### Is there any type of content that is prohibited?[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines.html)

To ensure that CAKE.com Marketplace is a safe platform, we’ve created standards that define and prohibit content that is harmful, inappropriate or offensive to others.

***Hate speech.***

Add-ons that promote violence, or incite hatred against individuals, or a group of individuals based on race, ethnicity, religion, age, disability, nationality, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or any other characteristic associated with discrimination will not be published.

***Violence.***

We don’t allow add-ons that facilitate or promote violence or endangerment of an individual’s safety.

***Bullying and harassment.***

Add-ons that contain or encourage threats, harassment and bullying will not be published.

***Harmful and malicious products.***

Add-ons that promote or support any type of harmful and malicious products won’t be published.

### Final note[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines.html)

Keep in mind that assets that contain any type of prohibited content will not be published. Also, any prohibited, or harmful content that is added after reviewing and publishing, and reported by users, will be removed from the marketplace immediately.
Please note that these guidelines should be used in addition to our [Terms of Use](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/terms.html), [Privacy Policy](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/privacy.html), [Security Requirements](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines.html) and [Listing Agreement](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/cake-com-marketplace-listing-agreement.html). Be sure to read all of these documents.
Also, keep in mind that these guidelines evolve along with our business. Feel free to get in touch if you have any feedback, or suggestions.

## Create add-on[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines.html)

### How to create add-on?[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines.html)

You’ll have complete independence and autonomy over building your add-on. This means that you’ll build it locally, but before submitting your code for a review, you should test it in the testing environment provided to you. Also, check out our [REST API documentation](https://docs.developer.clockify.me/) and Development Toolkit section to get a better insight on how to build and maintain add-ons. Add-on then needs to be approved by our developers in the reviewing process and then it can be published.  
To make sure the whole process goes smoothly and your request is approved shortly, we will provide you with the necessary requirements and standards all CAKE.com add-ons should meet in order to be published.

> When creating an add-on you’re actually creating the first version of your add-on. All subsequent iterations will be defined as versions in the Marketplace (e.g. v 1.0.1).

To create add-on:

1. Log in or sign up for your [developer account](https://developer.marketplace.cake.com/)
2. Go to ***Add-ons*** page
3. Click ***CREATE ADD-ON***

Now, complete a two-step process and enter the required data.

1. Basic information

* ***Add-on icon***: Upload image
* ***Add-on name***: Choose a descriptive name that users can easily understand
* ***Add-on manifest***: Enter URL
* ***Product***: Refers to the application for which you are creating add-on

At the moment, you can only choose Clockify. You’ll be able to create add-ons for Pumble and Plaky soon.

* ***Visibility***: Public – Add-on is visible to everyone and allows users within the CAKE.com community to share it.

At the moment, add-ons can only be public. Private add-ons are coming soon.

* ***Pricing model***: Define pricing model for your add-on.

`Free
Paid`

Click ***NEXT*** to proceed to the second step of the form.

> You can always save the form as draft and edit it later.

2. Listing

Information you add in the listing will be available in the Marketplace. Use it to help drive users to your add-on.

* ***Choose category***: Define a niche or business sector you’d like to improve by building this add-on. In the Marketplace, published add-on will be placed in the category you selected here.
* ***Short description***: Give a short overview of the purpose of your add-on and solution it provides
* ***Long description***: Explain what your add-on is providing in greater detail and the value it brings to users
* ***Privacy policy***: Define privacy policy and clearly disclose which information you’re collecting in this manner
* ***Terms of use*** (optional): Along with privacy policy, you can also add terms of use users need to agree to, in order to proceed with installation

> Please keep in mind that, if there are some contradictory statements in terms of use you provided here, to those written by our legal team, CAKE.com’s legal policy should be followed.

* ***Website*** (optional): Add a link to the website that contains more information about add-on. Creating a website that promotes your add-on can help you attract more users.
* ***Add-on gallery*** (optional): Upload a set of images, or screenshots that reflect the purpose and promote your add-on in the best way. You can upload up to 5 images.
* ***Demo video*** (optional): Add demo to spread the word, boost traffic, or use it as an instructional video. Video needs to be publicly accessible on YouTube.

We encourage you to provide some additional instructions, including information that would be relevant to the person doing an add-on review like some additional notes or any other kind of specific guidelines.

Finally, by checking the Marketplace Listing Terms box you agree that you’ll meet and oblige the [listing terms](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/cake-com-marketplace-listing-agreement.html) stated there as long as your add-on is part of the CAKE.com Marketplace.

Information provided in this step will be published and available along with the add-on on the [Marketplace website](https://marketplace.cake.com/).

> Information provided in the two-step forms above, must be written in English.

After you’ve completed the two steps, click the ***SUBMIT FOR REVIEW*** button and your add-on will be submitted to the CAKE.com Marketplace team for a review.

> Once you’ve submitted your add-on for a review, our team will start the reviewing process soon as possible.

### How does reviewing work?[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines.html)

> In order to successfully submit your add-on version for a review, all the fields need to be filled out correctly and there should be no pending requests.

Once you click the ***SUBMIT FOR REVIEW*** button, a new add-on version request will be created. Request will get a pending status and will be sent to our team for a review. You will get an email that confirms you have successfully submitted a request for new version.

> Reviewing process will take approximately two weeks.

When it’s done, you will receive an email informing you that your request is approved, or denied. The request will also be appropriately marked as approved or denied in your profile.

If denied, we’ll send you the feedback notes from our team that could help you understand why the request was denied. You’ll also be able to see the request, edit it based on the feedback you received and submit it for a review again.

If approved, you can continue and publish the version directly from the email you received, by clicking ***PUBLISH***. You’ll receive another confirmation email that will inform you that your add-on is published and available in the marketplace. Click ***View [addonname]*** to see it in the marketplace.

## Create version & publish[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines.html)

### How to create new version?[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines.html)

Every created add-on must have a version. Versioning add-ons helps you create and improve add-on’s functionality easily and gradually without causing inconvenience to your users.

In order to create a new version, at least one version of an add-on needs to be published. Learn more about how to create add-on’s first version on Create Add-on section above.

First version will be automatically created as version 1.0.0. For each new request, you need to manually add the version number. Version number should reflect complexity of the functionalities with major version being marked as e.g. 1.1.0 and minor version as e.g. 1.0.1. Also, keep in mind that version numbers should be marked in a logical progression, e.g. 2.0.0 version cannot be followed by version 1.5.0.

Creating new version is a three-step process similar to the one used to create an add-on.
However, when creating new version, add-on name and icon in the Basic information page are generated from the published version, but can be edited. Steps two and three are the same.

### Which status can version request have?[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines.html)

Based on its lifecycle stage, status of add-on’s version request can be:

* Draft

Version request is in draft if you haven’t completed all the steps when creating an add-on, but you saved information you entered by clicking the Save as draft button.

* Pending

When you submit the version for a review, its status is updated to Pending. After review, the version can be approved or declined with status changing accordingly.

> There can be only one pending request per add-on.

* Declined

After your version is reviewed, it can be approved or declined. If your version is declined, along with that information, you will also get an explanation on why. You can edit the declined version based on this feedback and submit it for a review again.

* Approved

An approved version is approved by our team. It goes further into the publishing cycle and is ready to be published.

* Published

This is the final step in the publishing cycle. Once the version is approved, it can be published and when published it becomes available in the marketplace for everyone to use.
After you published one add-on version, you can proceed by creating a new one.

Once your add-on (first, or any subsequent version) has been published on the CAKE.com Marketplace, you’ll receive a confirmation email saying that your add-on version has been successfully published.

> Add-on can have only one published version.

If an add-on is already in the marketplace, once its new version request is published, the existing published version immediately becomes outdated.

* Outdated

If a newer version is published, the existing one becomes automatically deprecated and outdated.

* Unlisted

This status is added to the published version that has been removed from the marketplace and can’t be used or installed by new users. However, those who use the unlisted version can still see and use it.

## Delete add-on[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines.html)

You can delete an entire add-on with all of its versions regardless of their status, or just an add-on’s version request. You can do both of these actions from the Add-ons page, in your profile. However, deleting an entire add-on requires sending a request to our support team.

### How to delete add-on?[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines.html)

If you’d like to delete your add-on, you can do that from the ***Add-ons*** page.

To delete an add-on:

1. Click ***Delete add-on*** in the bottom right corner
2. Delete add-on modal appears
3. Click ***SEND REQUEST***

After you’ve sent the request to delete an add-on, our support team will contact you shortly, and ask for confirmation. Soon after your confirmation, the process of deletion will start. Add-on users will receive an email that informs them of deletion and you will receive an email that notifies you that the process has begun.

Once the process has started, add-on is unlisted, removed from the marketplace and unavailable for new users. The existing users will be able to use the add-on until it is deleted. To ensure that they are informed, after the deletion process is set in motion, information of the deletion and add-on’s retirement date will be prominently displayed at the top of the page throughout the application.

> The process of deletion lasts 31 days. An add-on will be deleted at the end of the last day at midnight. This process cannot be canceled or reversed.

After it is deleted:

* Add-on will be deleted from the marketplace
* Your profile and all users will lose access to it
* Subscription will be canceled for paid add-ons

### How to delete add-on version request?[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines.html)

If you don’t want to continue with the process of creating a new add-on version, you can delete it in the request preview table, in the ***Add-ons*** page.

When deleting an add-on version, depending on the status of the version, different actions are available.

If version is in:

* Draft

If this is the only version request for this add-on, by deleting it, you will delete an entire add-on and if not, you will delete only draft version of this add-on.

* Pending

If this is the only version request for this add-on, by deleting it, you will delete an entire add-on and if not, you will delete only draft version of this add-on.

* Approved

If this is the only version request for this add-on, by deleting it, you will delete an entire add-on and if not, you will delete only draft version of this add-on.

* Declined

If this is the only version request for this add-on, by deleting it, you will delete an entire add-on and if not, you will delete only draft version of this add-on.

* Outdated

If this is the only version request for this add-on, by deleting it, you will delete an entire add-on and if not, you will delete only draft version of this add-on.

> You cannot delete the Unlisted and Published add-on versions since that action would affect potential users of those add-ons.

## Data privacy guidelines[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines.html)

As you’ll have access to customer information which includes personal data, it’s important how you store and handle the data. Personal data is sensitive and in many cases regulated by applicable laws. Listed below are best practices you should follow, in addition to the [Terms of Use](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/terms.html), when developing the add-on on the CAKE.com marketplace.

### Clearly explain your data privacy practices[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines.html)

When submitting your add-on for review you are required to provide a Privacy policy which should explain to the users how you plan on using their data. The privacy policy should clearly explain to the user what data the add-on will collect, how that data will be used, who will have access to the data and explain the user’s choice.

### Minimize the data you collect[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines.html)

Collect data only where you need it. Do not collect the data because you think it may be useful later. Where personal data is involved, consider de-identifying it. Also consider deleting user data when they request it or when they uninstall your add-on. Have in mind that you don’t need to store data indefinitely, put some data retention schemes in place.

### Get consent for certain data use[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines.html)

When submitting an add-on for review you’ll have to check which data you collect in the permissions tab. You should only collect the data you checked in that tab. In this way users consent to the usage of their data when installing an add-on, but only for the purpose of an add-on. Using data for marketing, sharing data with third-parties and other data use cases not strictly required to support the operation of your add-on may require a separate consent from the user before collecting or using the data. As a general rule of thumb, you should always get consent if the user would not expect their data to be used or shared in a particular way given the purpose of your add-on.

Consent may not be embedded in a privacy policy. Instead, it must be collected from the user directly. You are responsible for collecting and maintaining all such consents, either through the add-on itself or through direct communication with the add-on user.

Note, regardless of whether you obtain consent, some data use cases may be prohibited by the [Terms of Use](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/terms.html). You are responsible for reviewing and complying with those terms.

### Provide access, modification and erasure of personal data[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines.html)

Applicable laws and data management best practices require that you make it easy for users to get a copy of, correct and delete their personal data. This means, if you are storing personal data, you need to know where that personal data is at all times and be able to update it or remove it upon request.

### Offer additional data processing terms[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines.html)

If you are accessing, storing or otherwise processing personal data of EEA residents, users may request that you sign and comply with additional data protection terms, consistent with Article 28 of the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). You are responsible for understanding and complying with the terms required under Article 28 of the GDPR as it relates to the user data you access, store or otherwise process in connection with the user’s consent to install and share data with your add-on.

### Invest in data security[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines.html)

You must take reasonable steps to protect user data shared with you and collected by your add-on, including user device information. We recommend you to follow our Security guidelines for a more comprehensive list for securing your add-on.

In the event your add-on or suppliers experience a data security breach, you are responsible for communicating with users and regulators, as required by applicable law. It’s also important to let us know of the incident by emailing to [support@cake.com](mailto:support@cake.com).

## Security requirements[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines.html)

### Authentication & authorization[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines.html)

An add-on must authenticate and authorize every request on all endpoints exposed. Anonymous access to application endpoints and resources can be allowed in scenarios where it is needed.

### Data protection[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines.html)

1. Any CAKE.com End User Data stored by an application outside of the CAKE.com product or users’ browser must ensure full disk encryption at-rest. If accessed by an application or a service, it should be authenticated and authorized appropriately.
2. An application must use TLS version 1.2 (or higher) to encrypt all of its traffic, and enable HSTS with a minimum age of one year.
3. An application must follow the “Principle of Least Privilege”, when requesting app scopes. This means that an application should only request scopes required to perform its intended functionality, and nothing more.
4. An application must securely store and manage secrets, which include OAuth tokens, sharedSecret, API keys, and encryption keys. They cannot be stored in places that are easily accessible. Examples of places include:

* Source code and code repository tools, such as Bitbucket and Github
* URL strings
* Referer headers
* Application logs

### Application security[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines.html)

1. An application must maintain and securely configure domains where the application is hosted.
2. When applicable, an application must enable security headers and cookie security attributes.
3. An application must validate and sanitize all untrusted data and treat all user input as unsafe to mitigate injection-related vulnerabilities. Untrusted data is any input that can be manipulated to contain a web attack payload.
4. An application must not use versions of third-party libraries and dependencies with known critical or high vulnerabilities. When vulnerabilities in these libraries and dependencies are discovered, application developers must remediate them as quickly as possible.

### Privacy[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines.html)

1. An application must not collect or store credentials belonging to CAKE.com user accounts such as user passwords or user API tokens.

### Vulnerability management[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/clockify/publish/publishing-and-guidelines.html)

1. You must notify CAKE.com of all security incidents via [support@cake.com](mailto:support@cake.com).
2. Your account email will be taken as a security contact where you’ll be notified about vulnerabilities in the app.

* When we have a legitimate interest in processing your personal information to operate our business or protect our interests (e.g., to provide, maintain, and improve our products and services, conduct data analytics, and communicate with you).
* To comply with our legal obligations (e.g., to maintain a record of your consents and track those who have opted out of marketing communications).
* When we have your consent to do so (e.g., when you opt in to receive marketing communications from us). When consent is the legal basis for our processing your personal information, you may withdraw such consent at any time.

***Data Retention***

We store your personal information for as long as necessary to carry out the purposes for which we originally collected it and for other legitimate business purposes, including to meet our legal, regulatory, or other compliance obligations.

***Data Subject Requests***

To the extent required under applicable law, you have the right of:

* ***Access.*** You have the right to request a copy of the personal information we are processing about you, which we will provide to you in electronic form.
* ***Rectification.*** You have the right to require that any incomplete or inaccurate personal information that we process about you is amended.
* ***Deletion.*** You have the right to request that we delete personal information that we process about you, unless, for example, we are required to retain such data in order to comply with a legal obligation or to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
* ***Restriction.*** You have the right to request that we restrict our processing of your personal information where: (i) you believe such data to be inaccurate; (ii) our processing is unlawful; or (iii) we no longer need to process such data for a particular purpose, but where we are not able to delete the data due to a legal or other obligation or because you do not want us to delete it.
* ***Portability***. You have the right to request that we transmit the personal information we hold with respect to you to another data controller.
* ***Objection.*** Where the legal justification for our processing of your personal information is our legitimate interest, you have the right to object to such processing on grounds relating to your situation (e.g., direct marketing). We will abide by your request unless we have compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests and rights, or if we need to continue to process the data for the establishment, exercise or defense of a legal claim.
* ***Withdrawing Consent.*** If you have consented to our processing of your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, free of charge. Please note that if you withdraw your consent, this will not affect the lawfulness of our use and processing of your information on the basis of your consent before the point in time when you withdraw your consent.

Some rights may be limited, and we may need to retain certain personal information, as required or permitted by applicable law. If you would like to further inquire about, or exercise any of these rights, please contact us at [support@cake.com](mailto:support@cake.com).

***International data transfer***

We take steps to ensure that we handle your personal information subject to appropriate safeguards. As a US-based company, most of our operations are conducted in the United States and in order to provide the Sites, personal information will be processed in the United States, where laws regarding processing of personal information may be less stringent than the laws in your country. We provide appropriate protections for cross-border transfers as required by applicable law for international data transfers. With respect to transfers originating from the European Economic Area, Switzerland or the UK, where applicable, the standard contractual clauses and the international data transfer addendum to the European Commission’s standard contractual clauses for international data transfers, approved by the European Commission and the UK Information Commissioner, respectively, are implemented. Where required by such laws, you may request a copy of the suitable mechanisms we have in place by contacting us as detailed below.

In some cases, we may provide you with the option to choose the location, including locations in the EEA, in which we store and process your data. To the extent we provide that option to you, we will only process and store your data in the designated location and not transfer your data outside that jurisdiction, except in accordance with applicable law.

***Questions or Complaints***

If you have a concern about our processing of personal information that we are not able to resolve, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the Data Protection Authority where you reside. Contact details for your Data Protection Authority can be found using the links below:

# Advanced Concepts[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/advanced-concepts.html)

## Authorization[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/advanced-concepts.html)

Pumble uses OAuth2 in order to allow your app to access the API.

* User first clicks on a link to Install/Authorize your app. This link can either be through Pumble's `Configure Apps` page or externally through a website.
* This link will open the Pumble Consent screen that will display the scopes that are requested.
* User clicks `Allow`, and Pumble will redirect the user to your `redirectUrl`. Pumble will add a query parameter to this url called `code`.
* Using this code and your `clientSecret` (that is returned when you [create your app](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/manifest.html)) you will be able to generate an access token.
* With this access token you will be able to use the pumble api.

The link that will open the Pumble consent screen is in this format:

`https://app.pumble.com/access-request?redirectUrl=<REDIRECT_URL>&clientId=<CLIENT_ID>&scopes=<SCOPES>&defaultWorkspaceId=<DEFAULT_WORKSPACE_ID>&isReinstall=true`

| name | required | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| redirectUrl | yes | The redirect url where user will be redirected after they click `Allow`. This redirect url must match one of your app's `redirectUrls`. This means that if you have a redirect url of `https://example.com/redirect` it will match `https://example.com/redirect/other` but not `https://example.com` |
| clientId | yes | The id of your app |
| scopes | yes | The scopes that you have defined in your manifest. These scopes are send as a comma separated list of user scopes + bot scopes. Bot scopes however are prepended with `bot:`, for example: `messages:read,messages:write,bot:messages:read,bot:messages:write`. Scopes can be only a subset or the full list of scopes that you have defined in your manifest. To view a list of all scopes, click [here](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/api-client.html) |
| defaultWorkspaceId | no | The default workspace id to open consent screen to. Users will have the option to change the workspace, but when `defaultWorkspaceId` is provided that workspace will be preselected. |
| isReinstall | no | If you need to reauthorize the bot with new scopes, reInstallation is required, sending this query parameter with `true` will trigger a reinstallation, and therefore bot will be reauthorized |

After user authorizes, they will be redirected to the specified `redirectUrl`, the authorization code will be in the `code` query parameter of the `redirectUrl`.
Using this code and your `clientSecret` provided when [creating your app](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/manifest.html) you will be able to generate the access token for that user and for your bot.

```
1curl 
2curl --location 'https://api-ga.pumble.com/oauth2/access' \
3--form 'client-id="<<YOUR CLIENT ID>>"' \
4--form 'client-secret="<<YOUR CLIENT SECRET>>"' \
5--form 'code="<<AUTHORIZATION CODE>>"'
```

After this request you will receive back this payload:

```
1{
2    "accessToken": "<<User's access token>>",
3    "botToken": "<<Bot's access token>>",
4    "userId": "<<User Id>>",
5    "botId": "<<Bot Id in that workspace>>",
6    "workspaceId": "<<Workspace ID>>"
7}
```

If your app requires a bot user, `botToken` and `botId` will be returned on every authorization.
However it's good practice to always save them since one of these authorizations might be a reinstallation, therefore a new bot token is generated and the old one is invalidated.

TIP

Access tokens generated do not need to be refreshed.  
They can however be invalidated by the user (when users unauthorize)

### Using the SDK[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/advanced-concepts.html)

Pumble SDK provides an easy way to set up the redirect page to capture authorization codes, generate access tokens and store them.
All you need to do is setup a Token Store in your app, and enable redirect.

```
1const app: App = {
2    tokenStore: new JsonFileTokenStore('tokens.json'),
3	redirect: { enable: true }
4	//... Triggers
5};
```

In order to return a custom page / response when user authorizes or access token generation fails all you need to do is override
`onSuccess` and `onError` callbacks in the `redirect` configuration.

```
1const app: App = {
2    tokenStore: new JsonFileTokenStore('tokens.json'),
3    redirect: {
4        enable: true,
5        onSuccess: (tokens, request, response) => {
6            // This is called after tokens are saved in the store (if provided any)
7            response.send('Authorization completed');
8        },
9        onError: (error, request, response) => {
10            response.status(401).send('Could not authorize');
11        },
12    },
13	//... Triggers
14};
```

WARNING

If `onSuccess` or `onError` overridden, please make sure to always return a `response`

## Token Store[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/advanced-concepts.html)

Token store is the mechanism Pumble SDK uses to save the Access Tokens after they are generated and to get `ApiClient` in the relevant contexts.  
Pumble SDK provides to pre-implemented token stores: `JsonFileTokenStore` and `MongoDbTokenStore`.  
You can also implement your own custom store by just providing an implementation with this interface:

```
1export interface CredentialsStore {
2    getBotToken(workspaceId: string): Promise<string | undefined>;
3    getUserToken(
4        workspaceId: string,
5        workspaceUserId: string
6    ): Promise<string | undefined>;
7    getBotUserId(workspaceId: string): Promise<string | undefined>;
8    saveTokens(accessTokenResponse: OAuth2AccessTokenResponse): Promise<void>;
9    initialize(): Promise<void>;
10}
```

## Adding new HTTP routes[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/advanced-concepts.html)

Internally Pumble SDK is using an `express.js` http server to receive events from Pumble and to expose the redirect endpoint.
However in case you need to add your custom endpoints you have two alternatives:

1. Create another HTTP server in a different port
2. Extend the existing HTTP server

To extend the existing HTTP server all you have to do is add `onServerConfiguring` in the `App`

```
1const app: App = {
2    onServerConfiguring: (express, addon) => {
3        express.get("/my_custom_endpoint", (request, response)=>{
4			const userClient = await addon.getUserClient("<<workspace_id>>", "<<user_id>>")
5            response.send("My response");
6        })
7    },
8	//... Triggers
9};
```

Notice that in this callback you also have access to the `addon` object, which provides you with some helper methods to get [ApiClients](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/api-client.html), access [manifest](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/manifest.html), generate OAuth2 url etc.

## Handling Errors[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/advanced-concepts.html)

The addon will emit errors every time some uncaught error occurs in one of your event handlers.
In order to capture these errors use the code below:

```
1async function main() {
2    const addon = await start(app);
3    addon.onError((error)=>{
4        console.log("Error handling event: ", error);
5    })
6}
7
8main();
```

## Request Signature Verification[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/advanced-concepts.html)

Every request that is coming from Pumble is signed using your `signingSecret`.
While the `Pumble SDK` does this automatically, below is and explanation how the verification is done:

```
1function verifySignature(signingSecret: string) {
2    const TIMESTAMP_HEADER = 'x-pumble-request-timestamp';
3    const SIGNATURE_HEADER = 'x-pumble-request-signature';
4    return (request: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
5        const timestamp = request.headers[TIMESTAMP_HEADER];
6        const signature = request.headers[SIGNATURE_HEADER];
7        if (!timestamp || !signature) {
8            res.status(403).send('Invalid signature!');
9            return;
10        }
11        const rawBody = request.rawBody;
12		// The string to be signed is timestamp:rawBody
13        const signingPayload = `${timestamp}:${rawBody}`;
14        const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', signingSecret);
15        const testSignature = hmac
16            .update(signingPayload)
17            .digest()
18            .toString('hex');
19        if (testSignature !== signature) {
20            res.status(403).send('Invalid signature!');
21            return;
22        }
23        next();
24    };
25}
```

# Api Client[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/api-client.html)

Every Request to Pumble api must be sent with two headers

1. `x-app-token`: Your app token that you receive when app is created. See [manifest](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/manifest.html)
2. `token`: The access token of the user or bot. See [Authorization](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/advanced-concepts.html)

`pumble-sdk` provides an easy way to get the user or bot client from a trigger context. See [Triggers](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/triggers-reference.html)

Each ApiClient method has its own set of required scopes.

# Blocks[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/blocks.html)

### Quick message overview[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/blocks.html)

Pumble messages comprise both `text` and `blocks`. The `blocks` array contains JSON data, which is rendered according to predefined parsing rules.
When valid blocks are provided, Pumble uses them to render the message.
If block parsing fails or if no blocks are present, Pumble displays the fallback text defined in the `text` field.

## Rich text formatting[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/blocks.html)

Each block contains a `type` field that determines the block's type and, consequently, how the block will be parsed.
Text can be formatted using the `rich_text` block type, which includes an array of `elements` containing various sections and components of rich text.

### Section[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/blocks.html)

A section represents one or more lines of text, depending on its content. Each new section must start in a new line, regardless of what the section before it was.
There are 4 types of sections, with their values for their `type` field:

Text section `type: “rich_text_section”`  
Quote section `type: “rich_text_quote”`  
Code block section `type: “rich_text_preformatted”`  
List section `type: “rich_text_list”`

#### Text section[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/blocks.html)

Besides the `type` field, the text section also has an `elements` field.
There are 7 different types of items:

* Text `type: “text”` which has an additional `text` field.
* User mention `type: “user”` with an additional field named `user_id`.
* Channel mention `type: “channel”` with an additional field named `channel_id`.
* User group mention `type: “usergroup”` with an additional field named `usergroup_id`.
* Broadcast mention `type: “broadcast”` with an additional field named `range` (with `channel` and `here` as possible values for it).
* Link `type: “link”` with an additional `url` parameter. Emails will be sent as `mailto: links`. Links have an optional `text` field that, if present, will be displayed and hyperlinked with the provided `url`.
* Emoji `type: “emoji”` with an additional `name` parameter, that contains the alias for the emoji. It may also have an additional `skin_tone` field with a value in range `[2, 6]`, for emojis that support it. If the default skin tone should be applied, the `skin_tone` parameter will not be present at all.

All items have an optional `style` field. It represents an object consisting of 4 optional boolean fields. Applicable fields will be present in a JSON format with their values being set to `true`.
Allowed `style` fields are `bold`, `italic`, `strike` (strikethrough) and `code` (inline code blocks, only applicable to `text` items).

Basic example:

```
1[
2    {
3        "type": "rich_text",
4        "elements": [
5            {
6                "type": "rich_text_section",
7                "elements": [
8                    {
9                        "type": "text",
10                        "text": "Simple text"
11                    }
12                ]
13            }
14        ]
15    }
16]
```

Following example results in:  
**bold** *italic* ~~strike~~ `code` ***~~all four~~***

```

3        "type": "rich_text",

12                            "bold": true
13                        }
14                    },
15                    {

23                            "italic": true
24                        }

#### Code block section[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/blocks.html)

The code block section (`type: "rich_text_preformatted"`) also has the `elements` array which consists of only one `text` object without any formatting.

For example:

```
1[
2    {
3        "type": "rich_text",
4        "elements": [
5            {
6                "type": "rich_text_preformatted",
7                "border": 0,
8                "elements": [
9                    {
10                        "type": "text",
11                        "text": "public static void main(String[] args) {\n    System.out.println(\"Hello Pumble!\");\n}"
12                    }
13                ]
14            }
15        ]
16    }
17]
```

This example results in

```
1public static void main(String[] args) {
2    System.out.println("Hello Pumble!");
3}
```

#### List section[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/blocks.html)

A list section contains 5 attributes:

* `style` - Determines the type of the list, with `ordered` and `bullet` as possible values.
* `indent` - Determines the indentation level of the list. It accepts a value in the range from 0 to 4, inclusive.
* `border` - Determines if the list has a border on the leftmost side, similar to the quote section. Possible values are 0 for no border and 1 for a border to be displayed.
* `offset` - Indicates that the list is a continuation of a previous list section of the same indent. The value of this parameter is an integer, denoting how many items were in a previous list section(s) so that the UI can know where to continue counting the indices. This field only appears in `ordered` lists.
* `elements` - Elements in a list section aren’t regular items like in other sections, they are text sections. Each of those text sections represents one item in the list visually and can hold all the items a regular text section can.

The largest continuous run of list items with the same indent level will be formatted under the same list section. For an item with a different indent level, a new list section will be created.

Ordered lists are enumerated based on their indent level. Lists indented with 0 and 3 use Arabic numerals as indexes, lists indented with 1 and 4 use alphabetical indexes, and lists indented with 2 use Roman numeral indexes.

Unordered lists have three different bullet types: a filled circle '●' for indents 0 and 3, an empty circle '○' for indents 1 and 4, and a filled square '■' for indent 2.

For example:

In the example above, there are four list sections, all with `style: "ordered"`.

* The first section has an indentation of 0 and one item, which is a text section with one text item.
* The second section has an indentation of 1 and one item, similar to the first.
* The third section has an indentation of 2 and two items, each of which is a text section with one text item.
* The fourth section is a continuation of the first list section. It has an indentation of 0 and offset of 1 to indicate that the indices in it are offset by the count of the items in the first list.

# Interactivity[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/interactivity.html)

## Interactive messages[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/interactivity.html)

Pumble's interactive messages enhance communication by allowing users to perform actions directly within the message interface.
These messages can include buttons, select menus, and other interactive elements, enabling users to respond to requests, provide feedback, or trigger workflows without leaving the conversation.

### Compose your interactive message[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/interactivity.html)

Adding interactive components is similar to adding any other [block](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/blocks.html). The following example provides insight on how to add buttons in an actions block within a message payload:

```
1await ctx.say({
2    text:"John requests read permission for the header design document.",
3    blocks:[
4        {
5            type:"rich_text",
6            elements:[
7                {
8                    type:"rich_text_section",
9                    elements:[
10                        {
11                            type:"text",
12                            text:"John requests read permission for the header design document."
13                        }
14                    ]
15                }
16            ]
17        },
18        {
19            type:"actions",
20            elements:[
21                {
22                    type:"button",
23                    onAction:"approve_btn",
24                    value: "some-metadata",
25                    text:{
26                        text:"Approve",
27                        type:"plain_text"
28                    },
29                    style:"primary"
30                },
31                {
32                    type:"button",
33                    onAction:"reject_btn",
34                    text:{
35                        text:"Reject",
36                        type:"plain_text"
37                    },
38                    style:"danger"
39                }
40            ]
41        }
42    ]
43}, "in_channel");
```

You can replace buttons with other interactive elements based on your needs. After composing and sending such a message, it should soon be visible in your channel.

### Handle interactive payload[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/interactivity.html)

When a user interacts with an interactive component published by your app in Pumble, block interaction payload will be sent to your app.
This payload notifies your app about the interaction and provides a bundle of information about relevant details of the interaction. Understanding this payload is crucial for your app to process interactions effectively.

Pumble delivers this payload to your app's configured handlers.
The payload includes all the contextual information your app requires to determine the type and specifics of the interaction.  
Inside the payload, there is a `value` field that represents the actionable input value. For example, it corresponds to the `value` field from a button or the `value` field from a selected option if a select menu is used.  
Interaction payload for previous message when *Approve* button is pressed:

```
1interactionPayload = {
2    workspaceId: "668478600000000000000000",
3    userId: "668478600000000000000000",
4    channelId: "668478600000000000000000",
5    sourceType: "MESSAGE",
6    sourceId: "668478600000000000000000",
7    actionType: "button",
8    onAction: "approve_btn",
9    payload: { value: "some-metadata" } as string
10}
```

Take a look at following example on how to handle interactive payload based on previous message.

Inside your app's definition (like [here](https://github.com/CAKE-com/pumble-node-sdk/blob/master/playground/example-1.ts)), add following code:

```
1blockInteraction: {
2    interactions: [
3        {
4            sourceType: "MESSAGE",
5            handlers: {
6                "approve_btn": async ctx => {
7                    await ctx.ack();
8                    console.log(ctx.payload);
9                    // additional stuff you want to do
10                    await ctx.say({text: "Approved"}, "in_channel", true);
11                },
12                "reject_btn": async ctx => {
13                    await ctx.ack();
14                    console.log(ctx.payload);
15                    // additional stuff you want to do
16                    await ctx.say({text: "Rejected"}, "in_channel", true);
17                }
18            }
19        }
20    ]
21}
```

NOTE

`approve_btn` handler must correspond to the button's `onAction` field to correctly handle button interaction events.

For more types of interactive elements, click [here](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/interactive-elements-reference.html).

## Dynamic select menus[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/interactivity.html)

Dynamic select menu is interactive element that loads its options from an external data source, allowing for a dynamic list of options.
Each time a select menu of this type is opened or the user starts typing in the typeahead field, we'll send a request to your app.
For more details about dynamic select menu properties, see [this](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/interactive-elements-reference.html).

Your app should provide handlers that will be called each time user interacts with dynamic select menu.
The handler should return an array of options or option groups. See the following example.

Inside your app's definition (like [here](https://github.com/CAKE-com/pumble-node-sdk/blob/master/playground/example-1.ts)), add following code:

```
1dynamicMenus: [
2    {
3        onAction: "dynamic_menu_1",
4        producer: async (ctx) => {
5            return [
6                {text: {type: "plain_text", text: "Option 1"}, value: "1"},
7                {text: {type: "plain_text", text: "Option 2"}, value: "2"}
8            ]
9        }
10    }
11]
```

NOTE

`onAction` must match the `onAction` field of the dynamic select menu, otherwise the handler won't be called.

The provided handler will be executed when the following message is sent:

```
1await ctx.say({
2    text:"Dynamic select menu",
3    blocks:[
4        {
5            type:"actions",
6            elements:[
7                {
8                    type: "dynamic_select_menu",
9                    min_query_length: 3,
10                    onAction: "dynamic_menu_1",
11                    placeholder: {text: "Select something", type: "plain_text"}
12                }
13            ]
14        }
15    ]
16}, "in_channel");
```

# Overview[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/manifest.html)

The manifest is your App's configuration that should be registered in Pumble.  
All the information that Pumble needs to know about your app exists in that configuration.

This guide will show you how you can manually create and update your apps.  
You can also use `pumble-cli` instead of maintaining your apps manually which will automate this process for you, and will expose only the relevant details.\

## Creating an app[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/manifest.html)

To manually create an app with a manifest you should send a request to this Pumble API endpoint:

```
1POST https://api-ga.pumble.com/workspaces/{workspace_id}/workspaceUsers/{workspace_user_id}/apps
```

with this json body see [Manifest Payload](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/manifest.html):

```

# Modals & Views[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/modals-views.html)

Pumble's modals and views allow apps to create rich, interactive user interfaces beyond simple messages.

## Modals[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/modals-views.html)

Modals in Pumble are interactive, pop-up windows that provide a focused space for user interaction, ideal for collecting input or guiding multistep processes.
They allow apps to present dynamic forms and information, creating richer, more app-like experiences within Pumble.

### Key Concepts[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/modals-views.html)

* Views: Every modal is built using a view, which is a JSON object defining the UI layout and content. This allows you to arrange various UI components like text, input fields, buttons, and more.
* Focus & Interactivity: Modals are designed to capture user focus until they are submitted or dismissed. This makes them ideal for forms, confirmations, and any scenario requiring dedicated user interaction.
* View Stack: Modals can have a modal stack, allowing your app to push up to three modals. This enables multistep forms or wizards without closing the initial modal.

### When to Use Modals[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/modals-views.html)

Modals are best suited for situations where you need to:

* Collect User Input: Create forms with various input types (text fields, dropdowns, etc.) to gather data from users.
* Guide Multi-Step Workflows: Break down complex processes into digestible steps using the modal stack.
* Display Focused Information: Present details that require the user's undivided attention, such as summaries or configuration options.
* Confirm Actions: Prompt users for confirmation before performing critical operations.
* Present Dynamic Content: Show information that changes based on user input or external data.

### How Modals Work (Basic Flow)[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/modals-views.html)

1. Triggering the modal: A modal is typically opened in response to a user action, such as:
   * Clicking a button in a message (or interacting with any interactive component)
   * Using a slash command, global shortcut or message shortcut
2. Composing the view: Your app constructs a JSON object defining the modal's content and layout using blocks. This includes all the blocks and input elements.
3. Opening the modal: Your app makes call to `context.spawnModalView` to display the constructed view as a modal to the user.
4. User interaction: The user interacts with the elements within the modal (e.g., filling out forms, clicking buttons).
5. Handling submissions/closures: When the user submits the form or dismisses the modal, Pumble sends an interaction payload to your app's configured Request URL.
   * For submissions, payload includes all the submitted data in `state` field
   * For dismissals, your app can define if it will handle such event by setting `notifyOnClose` property
6. Responding to interactions: Your app processes the block interaction payload. Based on the input, it can:
   * Update the current view by using `context.updateView`
   * Push a new view onto the stack (by using `context.pushModalView`) for the next step
   * Present an error message within the modal if validation fails
   * Send a message to a channel based on the submission
   * Whatever you need to do ;)

Let's write some code :rocket:

##### Spawn modal[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/modals-views.html)

```
1globalShortcuts: [

20                  type: "input",
21                  blockId: "input_static_1",
22                  label: {
23                     text: "Select menu",
24                     type: "plain_text"
25                  },
26                  element: {
27                     type: "static_select_menu",
28                     placeholder: {text: "text", type: "plain_text"},
29                     onAction: "static_select_menu_input_action",
30                     options: [
31                        {text: {type: "plain_text", text: "Option 1"}, value: "1"},
32                        {text: {type: "plain_text", text: "Option 2"}, value: "2"} // value that's preselected in modal state
33                     ]
34                  },
35                  dispatchAction: true
36               },
37               {
38                  type: "actions",
39                  elements: [
40                     {
41                        type: "button",
42                        onAction: "info_btn_action",
43                        value: `test metadata`,
44                        text: {
45                           text: 'Read info',
46                           type: "plain_text"
47                        },
48                        style: "danger",
49                     }
50                  ]
51               }
52            ]
53         });
54      }
55   }
56]
```

WARNING

Don't call `ctx.ack()` in case you're handling modals (opening, updating or pushing new modals).

##### Handle submission[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/modals-views.html)

```
1viewAction: {
2    onSubmit: {
3      modal_callback_id_1: async (ctx) => {
4        await ctx.ack();
5        // block needs to be wrapped with block of type = "input" in order to be available in a view state
6        // in our case only static_select_menu_input_action (that's inside input_static_1) is available
7        console.log(`Modal state ${JSON.stringify(ctx.payload.view.state)}. Do whatever with it :)`);
8      }
9    },
10    onClose: {
11      // will be triggered only if notifyOnClose=true
12      modal_callback_id_1: async (ctx) => {
13        await ctx.ack();
14        console.log("Modal closed");
15      }
16    }
17  }
```

WARNING

For input values to be included in a view `state`, they must be wrapped within an `input` block. Furthermore, the `modal_callback_id_1` handler name must correspond to the value specified in the modal's `callbackId` property.

TIP

You can also receive block interaction events for modal inputs by setting `dispatchAction` to `true` in input block.

##### Handle block interactions[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/modals-views.html)

```
1blockInteraction: {
2   interactions: [
3      {
4         sourceType: "MESSAGE",
5         handlers: {
6            bttn_1_action: async (ctx) => {
7               await ctx.ack();
8               await ctx.say("Button 1 pressed", "ephemeral");
9            }
10         }
11      },
12      {
13         sourceType: 'VIEW',
14         handlers: {
15            static_select_menu_input_action: async (ctx) => {
16               await ctx.ack();
17               console.log("Static select from input in modal triggered, do something :)");
18            },
19            info_btn_action: async (ctx) => {
20               // no need to call ctx.ack when pushing new modal
21               await ctx.pushModalView(
22                   { parentViewId: ctx.payload.sourceId, ...}
23               );
24            },
25         },
26      }]
27}
```

NOTE

When pushing a new modal over an existing one, you must specify `parentViewId`, which represents the parent modal's `id`.

#### Take a look at detailed code examples :bulb: [interactivity-example](https://github.com/CAKE-com/pumble-node-sdk/tree/master/examples/interactivity).[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/modals-views.html)

## Home views[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/modals-views.html)

The Home tab (in app channel), is a private, customizable one-to-one space between a user and an app. It acts as a persistent dashboard where your app can display dynamic, personalized content and provide entry points for core functionality using blocks.

##### Publish home view[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/modals-views.html)

The Home view can be updated at any time an app deems appropriate, for instance, three seconds after a user authorizes the app:

```
1redirect: {
2    enable: true, path: "/redirect",
3    onSuccess: async (result, req, res) => {
4        if (result.botToken && result.botId && result.userId) {
5            setTimeout(async () => {
6                try {
7                    const addonManifest = await addonManifestPromise;
8                    const botClient = await addonManifest.getBotClient(result.workspaceId);
9                    // publish addon home view when user authorizes
10                    botClient?.v1.app.publishHomeView(result.userId, {callbackId: '', title: {...}, ...});
11                } catch (err) {
12                    console.error(err);
13                }
14            }, 3000);
15        }
16    }
17}
```

# Pumble CLI[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/pumble-cli.html)

Pumble CLI provides a set of tools that you can use for your app's development and configuration.
It will make the process of creating and maintaining your app easier.

To get started you can either install the cli globally `npm i -g pumble-cli` or use it with `npx`: `npx pumble-cli <command>`

To list the available commands and their usage simply use `pumble-cli --help` or `pumble-cli-command --help`

## Available commands[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/pumble-cli.html)

### `pumble-cli login`[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/pumble-cli.html)

Using `pumble-cli login` you will be prompted to enter your email address and the verification code that will be sent to your email.  
After these steps you are logged in and ready to use the cli.  
If you need to log in to another workspace simply use `pumble-cli login --force` or `pumble-cli logout && pumble-cli login`  
By default this command will save you authorization info in `~/.pumblerc` file.

If you need to check in which workspace you are logged in use `pumble-cli info`

### `pumble-cli create`[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/pumble-cli.html)

With `pumble-cli create` you will be able to generate a new app.  
It will create a default app with some triggers implemented.  
You will be prompted to provide some basic information such as `name` and `description`.  
After this command completes you can simply `cd` into the newly created directory and start your app with `npm run dev`  
After you execute `npm run dev` for the first time the Pumble app will be created and installed in your logged in workspace, so you will be ready to test it.
While having `npm run dev` running, every change you make in your project (adding removing triggers, changing `manifest.json`) will update your app.

### `pumble-cli logout`[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/pumble-cli.html)

With `pumble-cli logout` your authorization info will be removed effectively logging you out of the session

### `pumble-cli info`[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/pumble-cli.html)

Use `pumble-cli info` to check in which workspace you are logged in.

```
1╔════════════════╤══════════════════════════╗
2║ Workspace Id   │ 651122b0456aa466bf81c6b2 ║
3╟────────────────┼──────────────────────────╢
4║ Workspace Name │ my_workspace             ║
5╟────────────────┼──────────────────────────╢
6║ User Id        │ 651122b0456aa466bf81c6b3 ║
7╟────────────────┼──────────────────────────╢
8║ User Name      │ Your Name                ║
9╟────────────────┼──────────────────────────╢
10║ User Email     │ your.email@email.com     ║
11╚════════════════╧══════════════════════════╝
```

### `pumble-cli list`[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/pumble-cli.html)

With `pumble-cli list` you will list of your created apps. If you are using this command in the directory of a currently connected app,
the connected app will be indicated

### `pumble-cli connect`[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/pumble-cli.html)

Use `pumble-cli connect` in an app project directory to configure the environment to one of your Pumble Apps
You will be prompted to select an app and after selected the contents of `.pumbleapprc` will be replaced with the secrets of the newly connected app.

WARNING

After you run with `pumble-cli` your connected app will be updated with the new configuration & triggers.  
Use this command only to connect a previously connected app.  
i.e. You are checking out from your version control, but `.pumbleapprc` secrets file it's not in the repository. In this case `pumble-cli connect` becomes useful

### `pumble-cli scaffold`[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/pumble-cli.html)

Use this command to generate a project that mirrors one of your already configured apps.  
After running this command you will be prompted to pick one of your existing projects.
This will generate the template and configuration to match the Pumble app.  
`.pumbleapprc` will match the app's secrets. And all triggers and event subscriptions will be generated with empty handlers.  
You will just need to implement the handlers.

### `pumble-cli`[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/pumble-cli.html)

Running just `pumble-cli` in your project root will start your app.

## Installing[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/pumble-cli.html)

To install `pumble-cli` simply use `npm install -g pumble-cli` or run `npx pumble-cli` every time you need to run a command.
If `pumble-cli` is installed as a `devDependency` in your project however, you can just use `pumble-cli` in you npm scripts directly, without needing to install it globally.

```
1// package.json
2{
3	"scripts": {
4		"dev": "pumble-cli"
5	}
6}
```

## Running your app locally[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/pumble-cli.html)

To run your app locally simply run `pumble-cli` in your project root.  
This command will make sure to sync your manifest in Pumble and watch for changes.  
Since Pumble needs public endpoints to reach your app, `pumble-cli` will create a tunnel exposing your server port in a temporary generated public url using `https://localtunnel.me/`. If you want to have your own solution to expose your server publicly you can simply add `--host` and `--port` command arguments after `pumble-cli`

```
1pumble-cli --host=https://myhostname.com --port=8080
```

TIP

If you don't provide `--port`, `pumble-cli` will try to find free ports in your machine and listen to that port. This means you will not have a fixed port to expose, and `--port` solves the issue.

After `pumble-cli` starts your app's server, it will detect for changes in the manifest and update your manifest in Pumble.
So if you are running the command without a fixed `--host`, every time your run this command the manifest will be updated with the new hostname to reach your local environment.

## Running your app in production[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/pumble-cli.html)

To run in production after you have prepared your app for deployment and manifest is configured correctly, you simply have to run the compiled main file.

```
1//package.json
2{
3	"scripts": {
4		"compile": "tsc",
5		"run-prod": "node ./dist/main.js"
6	}
7}
```

## Preparing Your App for deployment[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/pumble-cli.html)

After you have finished developing your App locally and you are ready to deploy all that remains is that you configure all the urls where Pumble will send the events.  
Pumble will need to know the host where you will be deploying because it will send the events in the new URL's.
To do this through the `Pumble CLI` use this command

```
1npx pumble-cli pre-publish
```

This command will ask you for the hostname and after you input a valid hostname it will update all the urls in Pumble.
:::tip
To skip prompting for the hostname just run the command with:

```
1npx pumble-cli pre-publish --host https://yourhost.com
```

:::

To deploy your app make sure you have these environment variables set up
You can easily find these values in your local `.pumbleapprc` file

```
1PUMBLE_APP_ID=
2PUMBLE_APP_KEY=
3PUMBLE_APP_CLIENT_SECRET=
4PUMBLE_APP_SIGNING_SECRET=
```

WARNING

`Pumble CLI` is intended for local development only. In production however you only need to run you main compiled script.
This means that simply having `.pumbleapprc` in the root directory will not suffice, since that file is only used by the CLI.
Make sure to have these values as environment variables or set `id`, `appKey`, `signingKey` and `clientSecret` in your App

```
1const app: App = {
2	//...
3	id: '...'
4	signingSecret: '...',
5	clientSecret: '...',
6	appKey: '...'
7	//...
8};
```

# Triggers[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/triggers-reference.html)

Pumble apps can subscribe to two types of triggers:

1. App specific triggers ([Slash Commands](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/triggers-reference.html), [Global Shortcuts](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/triggers-reference.html), [Message Shortcuts](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/triggers-reference.html))
2. [Pumble Events](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/triggers-reference.html)

The payloads for each specific trigger exist on every event handler context

2    slashCommands: [
3        {
4            command: '/my_slash_command',
5            description: 'My slash command description',
6            usageHint: '[usage hint]',
7            handler: async (ctx) => {
8                console.log('Received slash command');
9            },
10        },
11	]

| messageId | string | no | The message id on which the shortcut was invoked |

## Events[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/triggers-reference.html)

To subscribe to events you have to add the listeners in the main `App`
Events do not need to be acknowledged.

```
1const app: App = {
2	events: [
3		{
4			name: "NEW_MESSAGE",
5			handler: async (ctx) => {
6
7			}
8		}
9	]
10}
```

There are two types of events:

1. [App specific events](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/triggers-reference.html) ( `APP_UNAUTHORIZED` and `APP_UNINSTALLED` )
2. [Pumble Events](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/triggers-reference.html)

While App specific events do not require any special scope to be able to receive them, Pumble Events usually requires the users or bots to have authorized your app with certain scopes to receive them.
So, for example, if you have `messages:read` scope for the bot but not for users, you will receive only `NEW_MESSAGE` events that the bot can read.

The list of Pumble Events and their scopes:

| event | scopes |
| --- | --- |
| `NEW_MESSAGE` | `messages:read` |
| `UPDATED_MESSAGE` | `messages:read` |
| `REACTION_ADDED` | `reaction:read` |
| `CHANNEL_CREATED` | `channels:read` |
| `WORKSPACE_USER_JOINED` | `user:read` |

### Unauthorize and Uninstall events[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/triggers-reference.html)

These events will be useful to cleanup the tokens in the token store, and do any other cleanup after user un-authorizes

```
1const app: App = {
2	events: [
3		{
4			name: "APP_UNAUTHORIZED",
5			handler: async (ctx) => {
6				console.log("UNAUTHORIZED USER", ctx.payload.body.workspaceUser)
7			}
8		}
9	]
10}
```

### Pumble Events[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/triggers-reference.html)

#### Pumble Events Context[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/triggers-reference.html)

| name | type | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| payload | [EventPayload#event-payload) | The payload for the global shortcut |
| getBotClient | () => Promise<ApiClient | undefined> | Get the bot ApiClient for the workspace where the trigger was invoked. If you ave set `{bot: false}` in the [manifest](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/manifest.html) this will return undefined |
| getUserClient | (userId: string) => Promise<ApiClient | undefined> | An event that arrives in your app can apply to more than one user. Therefore `getUserClient` the event is not user specific so `userId` must be provided. An exception for this rule applies to `NEW_MESSAGE`, `UPDATED_MESSAGE` and `REACTION_ADDED` event. The default user id in `getUserClient` for these events is the message/reaction author |
| getManifest | () => [Manifest](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/manifest.html) | Return the manifest of your app. This can be used if you need to access some manifest configuration or secret |
|  |  |  |
| getBotUserId | () => Promise<string | undefined> | Get the bot user id for the workspace where the trigger was invoked. If you ave set `{bot: false}` in the [manifest](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/manifest.html) this will return undefined |
| getAuthUrl | ()=> string | Generate an auth url that when opened it will show the Pumble Consent screen to authorize your app |

#### `NEW_MESSAGE` Event Context[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/triggers-reference.html)

`NEW_MESSAGE` Event context in addition to the normal events context has the `say` function. See [Reply Function](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/triggers-reference.html)

#### `REACTION_ADDED` Event Context[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/triggers-reference.html)

`REACTION_ADDED` Event context in addition to the normal events context has `fetchMessage` function.
This function will first try to find the `ApiClient` of the reaction author. If that is not successful it will fall back the the bot `ApiClient` and will try to fetch the message where the reaction was added.

#### Event Payload[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/triggers-reference.html)

| name | type | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| body | object | Event specific body |
| eventType | string | Type of the event |
| workspaceId | string | Workspace id where the event happened |
| workspaceUserIds | Array<string> | The list of users that have authorized the app with the required event scopes, and they have access to the event (bot can be included in this list) |

## Say function[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/triggers-reference.html)

Say function will use your app's bot to respond to a trigger.
By default it will send an `ephemeral` message to the triggering user.

```
1async say(message: string | {text: string, blocks?: Block[], attachments?: Attachment[]}, type: "in_channel" | "ephemeral" = "ephemeral"){...}
```

## Reply function[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/triggers-reference.html)

Reply function is similar to [Say Function](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/triggers-reference.html), but it has one more extra parameter `reply`.
This function applies only to contexts where a message or message id is present.

```
1await say("Message", "in_channel", true);
```

If it's set to true, the response will be posted as a reply to the original message. If the original message is in a thread, me response will be posted in the same thread.

# Basic Concepts[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/learn/introduction.html)

## Pumble App components[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/learn/introduction.html)

A Pumble App has three main parts:

1. **The manifest**: The manifest is your app definition registered in Pumble.
   In the manifest you define your app name, bot name, all your triggers, event subscriptions, scopes etc.
   While `pumble-cli` will make the process of creating and registering the manifest easy, you can read more about the manifest [here](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/manifest.html)
2. **The bot**: Optionally you can have a bot that comes along with your app. The bot is a user that represents your app in every workspace that your app is installed.  
   You can use the bot to display useful information about your app logic or simply use it to communicate with users. For every workspace you will have a different bot id.  
   When your app is installed in a workspace the bot user will be created and your app will receive an authorization code that, when used, will generate access tokens for both the user who installed your app and the bot. See [Authorization](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/advanced-concepts.html)
3. **Your app server**: Pumble will notify your app on every event and trigger on the installed workspaces through the **public** HTTP endpoints defined in the [manifest](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/manifest.html). So you will need to have a running HTTP server to be able to receive events and triggers from Pumble.

## Listening to messages[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/learn/introduction.html)

To listen to messages, in the main `app` object we define handlers for `NEW_MESSAGE` event.  
Make sure you have `messages:read` in the `botScopes` in your [`manifest.json`](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/learn/quick-start.html) (and optionally in `userScopes`)  
If only your App's bot has that scope you will listen to messages that bot has access to, otherwise you will receive messages for all authorized users with the scope.

The `NEW_MESSAGE` event handlers can have an optional `options` property.

| name | type | required | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| match | string|RegExp | no | Match if the message `text` includes a particular string or matches a RegExp pattern |
| includeBotMessages | boolean | no (default false) | If it's set to true your app bot messages will be received by the handler |

```
1const app: App = {
2	//...
3	events: [
4		{
5            name: 'NEW_MESSAGE',
6            handler: async (ctx) => {
7				console.log("Received a message.")
8            },
9		},
10		{
11            name: 'NEW_MESSAGE',
12            options: { match: "hello" },
13            handler: async (ctx) => {
14				console.log("Received a message with hello", 
15							ctx.payload.body.tx);
16            },
17		},
18		{
19            name: 'NEW_MESSAGE',
20            options: { match: /^hello/ },
21            handler: async (ctx) => {
22				console.log("Received a message that STARTS with hello", 
23							ctx.payload.body.tx);
24            },
25		},
26		{
27            name: 'NEW_MESSAGE',
28            options: { includeBotMessages: true },
29            handler: async (ctx) => {
30				console.log("Received user or bot message");
31            },
32		}
33	]
34	//...
35}
```

TIP

Events can have one or more handlers.

## Sending messages[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/learn/introduction.html)

The easiest way to send messages in your app is by using the `say()` function inside your listeners.  
The code below will send an ephemeral message on behalf of your App's bot.  
To be able to do this make sure you have `messages:write` scope for your bot (in your [`manifest.json`](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/learn/quick-start.html)).  
**To send a rich message, use the `blocks` field. Click [here](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/blocks.html) to see more details on `blocks`.**

```
1{
2	name: 'NEW_MESSAGE',
3	options: { includeBotMessages: true },
4	handler: async (ctx) => {
5		await ctx.say("Received a message");
6	}
7}
```

TIP

Ephemeral messages can be sent on any channel (including user's self channel, DM's, Group Conversations and Private or Public channel)  
They are sent only to the user who triggered the event, and they will not be persisted.

`say()` function also accepts a second argument which by default is `ephemeral` but it can be changed to `in_channel` in order
to post that message as a normal message.
In this case the bot will post a normal message.

```
1{
2	name: 'NEW_MESSAGE',
3	handler: async (ctx) => {
4		await ctx.say("Received a message", "in_channel");
5	}
6}
```

WARNING

While it's not required for the bot to be a member of the channel where it posts, if the bot is trying to post a message in a DM channel, or Group DM channel where he is not a member this method will fail.  
Bots will be able to post messages in any Public or Private channel.

To send message on behalf of users your app needs to have `messages:write` user [scope](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/learn/quick-start.html), and users should have authorized your app.

```
1{
2	name: 'NEW_MESSAGE',
3	handler: async (ctx) => {
4		// This will return author's client. 
5		// To get any other user in the same workspace user ctx.getUserClient(user_id)
6		const userClient = await ctx.getUserClient();
7		if (userClient) {
8			await userClient.v1.messages.postMessageToChannel(
9				ctx.payload.body.cId,
10				'Message form the same user'
11			);
12		}
13	}
14}
```

In some contexts that are related to a single message such as `MessageShortcut`, `NEW_MESSAGE`, `UPDATED_MESSAGE`, `REACTION_ADDED` the `say()` function has the ability to reply to the message.

```
1{
2	name: 'NEW_MESSAGE',
3	handler: async (ctx) => {
4		await ctx.say('Received your message', 'in_channel', true);
5	}
6}
```

## Listening to events[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/learn/introduction.html)

Just like `NEW_MESSAGE` Pumble apps can subscribe to a list of Pumble events.
Each event has its own payload and a list of user id's that have authorized your app and are eligible to receive that event

```
1const app: App = {
2	//... Triggers
3	events: [
4		{
5            name: 'REACTION_ADDED',
6            options: { match: ':robot_face:' },
7            handler: async (ctx) => {
8				console.log("Workspace IDs: ", ctx.payload.workspaceId);
9				console.log("User IDs: ", ctx.payload.workspaceUserIds);
10				console.log("Event Body: ", ctx.payload.body);
11                await ctx.say('RECEIVED ROBOT FACE');
12            },
13
14		}
15	]
16};
```

For more info about the available events, click [here](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/triggers-reference.html).

## Using the Pumble API[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/learn/introduction.html)

Your app can use the Pumble API on behalf of every user that has authorized it, or the bot in the workspace where your app is installed.
In order to use the build in ApiClient you need to set up the `tokenStore` in your App and enable `redirect` to be able to capture user [authorizations](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/advanced-concepts.html).

```
1const app: App = {
2    tokenStore: new JsonFileTokenStore('tokens.json'),
3	redirect: { enable: true }
4	//... Triggers
5};
```

There are two type of clients `botClient` and `userClient`
`botClient` can be accessible in every trigger or event, while `userClient` is available only in triggers, and some events such as `NEW_MESSAGE`, `UPDATED_MESSAGE`, `REACTION_ADDED`.

```
1const app: App = {
2	//...
3	slashCommands: [
4		{
5            command: '/my_slash_command',
6            handler: async (ctx) => {
7                await ctx.ack();
8                const botClient = await ctx.getBotClient();
9                if (!botClient) return;
10                const channel = await botClient.v1.channels.createChannel({
11                    name: 'ChannelFromBot',
12                    type: 'PUBLIC',
13                });
14                const userClient = await ctx.getUserClient();
15                if (!userClient) return;
16                await userClient.v1.messages
17					.postMessageToChannel(channel.channel.id, 'First channel message');
18            },
19        }
20	]
21};
```

TIP

Select either botClient or userClient depending on what you are trying to achieve.  
If you need to change user's custom status you need `userClient` for that.  
If you need to send a notification message you can use `botClient`

For each `ApiClient` method you are trying to invoke make sure your bot or user has the required scopes.

## Listening to triggers[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/learn/introduction.html)

There are 3 types of triggers that you App can define

1. Slash Commands
2. Global Shortcuts
3. Message Shortcuts

### Trigger Acknowledgement[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/learn/introduction.html)

Every trigger received must be acknowledged within 3 seconds, otherwise Pumble will consider it an error and return an ephemeral message to the user that your app is not available to handle the trigger.

```
1const app: App = {
2	//...
3	slashCommands: [
4		{
5            command: '/todo',
6            handler: async (ctx) => {
7                await ctx.ack();
8            }
9        }
10	]
11};
```

TIP

You can customize the message that Pumble sends to the user in case of a missed acknowledgement by setting `offlineMessage` in the `App`

```
1const app: App = {
2	//... config
3    offlineMessage: 'We are experiencing some issues at the moment. Please try again later',
4	//... Triggers
5};
```

### Slash Commands[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/learn/introduction.html)

Slash commands can be typed by the users on any channel or thread, in workspaces where your App is installed.  
A user does not have to be authorized in order to use your App's triggers, so `getUserClient()` in a trigger context might not always return a value.

Slash Command context in its payload has information about the workspace where it was triggered, the user who triggered it, the channel and if applied the thread id where it was triggered.
Also in the same payload you will receive a `text` property, which is the text that user typed after the slash command

```
1const app: App = {
2	//...
3	slashCommands: [
4		{
5            command: '/todo',
6            handler: async (ctx) => {
7                await ctx.ack();
8                const text = ctx.payload.text;
9				if(!["add","remove", "list"].include(text)){
10					await ctx.say("Invalid command");
11					return;
12				}
13				await ctx.say(`Triggered /todo ${text} from <<@${ctx.payload.userId}>>` )
14            },
15        }
16	]
17};
```

### Global Shortcuts[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/learn/introduction.html)

Global shortcuts are similar to Slash Commands with a slight difference:

* Global shortcut does not have a `text` property

```
1globalShortcuts: [
2	{
3		name: 'My Global Shortcut',
4		handler: async (ctx) => {
5			await ctx.ack();
6			await ctx.say(`Received global shortcut by <<@${ctx.payload.userId}>>`);
7		},
8	},
9]
```

### Message Shortcuts[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/learn/introduction.html)

Message shortcuts are shortcuts that are always associated with a single message. This means that message shortcuts will have `messageId` in the payload.  
Also message shortcuts have `fetchMessage()` method in their context, so it can be used to easily fetch the message where it was triggered.

```
1messageShortcuts: [
2	{
3		name: 'My Message Shortcut',
4		handler: async (ctx) => {
5			await ctx.ack();
6			await ctx.say(`Received message shortcut by <<@${ctx.payload.userId}>>`);
7			const message = await ctx.fetchMessage();
8			if (!message) return;
9			await ctx.say("The message text is: " + message.text);
10		},
11	},
12]
```

WARNING

`fetchMessage()` will try to find if the triggering user has authorized your app and if so, it will try to fetch the message on behalf of that user.  
This means that users must have `messages:read` scope.  
If this is not successful it will try to fetch the message using the bot (if bot has access to that message).

For more information about triggers and their contexts, click [here](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/triggers-reference.html).

### Interactive components[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/learn/introduction.html)

Interactive components are [block](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/blocks.html) elements that add interactivity and enable users to interact with buttons, select menus, and similar components.
For more information about interactive components, click [here](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build/interactivity.html).

## Authorization[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/learn/introduction.html)

When your App is published it will be visible to all workspaces, so they can install and authorize your app.  
Installation means that a bot user for your app will be created and you will receive both bot authorization code and user authorization code (for the user that installed your app initially)  
Other users in the workspace have to authorize in order for you app to receive their authorization codes.  
Users have to go to the `Configure Apps` page in Pumble (by clicking Add apps in the sidebar) and the will be able to install/authorize your app from there.

To capture the authorization codes of installing/authorizing users Pumble SDK provides a simple way to set up the page that Pumble will send users to, after they authorize.

```
1const app: App = {
2    tokenStore: new JsonFileTokenStore('tokens.json'),
3	redirect: { enable: true }
4	//... Triggers
5};
```

In order to share the installation link with a user you can use the `context.getAuthUrl()` in the context of triggers/events.

```
1const app: App = {
2	//...
3	slashCommands: [
4		{
5            command: '/my_slash_command',
6            handler: async (ctx) => {
7                await ctx.ack();
8				const userClient = await ctx.getUserClient();
9				if (!userClient) {
10                    await ctx.say(`Please use this link to authorize: ${ctx.getAuthUrl({defaultWorkspaceId: ctx.payload.workspaceId})}` )
11				} else {
12					await ctx.say(`You are authorized`)
13				}
14            },
15        }
16	]
17};
```

# Pumble SDK[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/learn/quick-start.html)

## Overview[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/learn/quick-start.html)

In this guide you will install `pumble-cli` and use it to generate a project for a Pumble App

## Quick Start[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/learn/quick-start.html)

Start by running this command to install the `Pumble CLI`

```
1npm i -g pumble-cli
```

After successfully installing `pumble-cli` use the command below to log in to your workspace

```
1pumble-cli login
```

You will be asked to input your email address and you will receive a code in your inbox.
After logging in you can proceed to create your first Pumble App.

```
1pumble-cli create
```

This command will ask you to type a name and description and will generate the project.  
After this command has completed you can then `cd` into the generated directory and start the addon.

```
1cd my_app
2npm run dev
```

If you login into Pumble you will see your App is installed and ready to use.

TIP

You can also skip installing `pumble-cli` and use `npx` instead

```
1npx pumble-cli create
```

## Project structure[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/learn/quick-start.html)

```
1.
2├── manifest.json
3├── .pumbleapprc
4├── package.json
5├── src
6│   └── main.ts
7└── tsconfig.json
```

### `manifest.json`[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/learn/quick-start.html)

In this file you can change your App's name, Bot title, and scopes

```
1{
2    "name": "my-app",
3    "displayName": "My App",
4    "botTitle": "My App Bot",
5    "bot": true,
6    "scopes": {
7        "botScopes": [
8            "messages:read",
9            "messages:write",
10        ],
11        "userScopes": [
12            "messages:read"
13        ]
14    }
15}
```

INFO

`manifest.json` in the generated project it's not the full [manifest](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/build//manifest.html) that is registered in Pumble.  
The full manifest is generated by the cli as a combination of this file, your application code in `src/main.ts` and the hostname in which the cli runs.

### `.pumbleapprc`[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/learn/quick-start.html)

After running your app for the first time with `npm run dev` this file will contain your app id and secrets.

### `src/main.ts`[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/learn/quick-start.html)

This is the main file for your project to run.

WARNING

It's recommended to keep this file name and location unchanged

```

# Private Add-ons Documentation[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/publish/private-addon-deployment.html)

## Introduction to Private Add-ons[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/publish/private-addon-deployment.html)

Private add-ons allow developers to create solutions accessible only to specific workspaces, ideal for internal testing and use. This feature encourages users with custom integrations to transition to managed add-ons, enhancing security.

## Creating a Private Add-on[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/publish/private-addon-deployment.html)

### Steps to Create:[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/publish/private-addon-deployment.html)

1. **Set Visibility**: Set Visibility: During creation, select "Private" visibility.
2. **Whitelist Workspaces**: Define up to three workspaces by their IDs for access.
3. **Manifest key**: If you already have the add-on in production, the manifest key needs to be different since the private add-on is technically a new add-on.

> **Note**: You can find your workspace ID by going to the workspace settings.

## Managing a Private Add-on[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/publish/private-addon-deployment.html)

### Updating Versions[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/publish/private-addon-deployment.html)

* Maintain whitelists across versions unless changes are needed.
* Upon removing a workspace from whitelists, the add-on is automatically uninstalled.
* When a new workspace is added, an email is sent notifying the user about the add-on.

## Publishing a Private Add-on[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/publish/private-addon-deployment.html)

### Key Differences:[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/publish/private-addon-deployment.html)

* **No Payment Setup**: Skip payment configuration.
* **No Vendor Profile**: Not required for private distribution.
* **No Review Process**: Immediate publication post-submission.
* **Can delete a Private Add-on without waiting.**

### Deleting a Private Add-on:[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/publish/private-addon-deployment.html)

* Deletion is immediate. All installations are removed upon deletion.

## Installing a Private Add-on[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/publish/private-addon-deployment.html)

### Admin Instructions:[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/publish/private-addon-deployment.html)

1. **Receive URL**: Obtain installation link via email notification.
2. **Install**: Use provided URL to install the add-on.
3. **Visibility**: See "Private" status in Clockify, distinguishing from public versions.

# Publishing Guidelines & Best Practices[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/publish/publishing-and-guidelines)

To get published in the CAKE.com Marketplace, your add-on must meet our quality, security, and privacy standards:

* **Functionality**: Your add-on must work as described and improve the experience of using Pumble.
* **User clarity**: Be transparent about your add-on’s purpose, setup, and data use.
* **Branding**: Follow Pumble’s branding guidelines for a cohesive output.
* **Setup simplicity**: Your add-on should be easy to install and use.
* **Security & privacy**: Handle all user data responsibly and comply with our Security and Data privacy requirements.

Assets containing hate speech, harassment, violence, or malicious content will not be published. If harmful or prohibited content is added later and reported, it will be removed right away.

These guidelines are intended to supplement our [Terms of Use](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/terms.html), [Privacy Policy](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/privacy.html), [Security Requirements](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/publish/publishing-and-guidelines) and [Listing Agreement](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/cake-com-marketplace-listing-agreement.html). We strongly encourage you to review all of these documents. Our guidelines may evolve over time as our business grows and changes. If you have feedback or suggestions, feel free to reach out.

## Versioning & Updates[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/publish/publishing-and-guidelines)

All add-ons in the Pumble ecosystem start with version 1.0.0. As you improve and update your product:

* Submit new versions via the developer dashboard.
* Clearly number each version (e.g., 1.1.0 for major, 1.0.1 for minor updates).
* Each version goes through the review process again before going live.
* Once a new version is published, the previous version becomes outdated.

## Remove Add-ons or Versions[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/publish/publishing-and-guidelines)

How to remove your add-on or a specific version?

* Developers can delete draft or pending versions directly.
* Published versions require a support request.
* Once deletion begins, existing users are notified and the add-on will be permanently removed after 31 days.

## Why Build for Pumble?[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/publish/publishing-and-guidelines)

With custom Pumble add-ons, you can:

* Improve team workflows.
* Integrate third-party tools your team already uses.
* Reach thousands of teams using Pumble every day.

## Security requirements[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/publish/publishing-and-guidelines)

### Authentication & authorization[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/publish/publishing-and-guidelines)

An add-on must authenticate and authorize every request on all endpoints exposed. Anonymous access to application endpoints and resources can be allowed in scenarios where it is needed.

### Data protection[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/publish/publishing-and-guidelines)

1. Any CAKE.com End User Data stored by an application outside of the CAKE.com product or users’ browser must ensure full disk encryption at-rest. If accessed by an application or a service, it should be authenticated and authorized appropriately.
2. An application must use TLS version 1.2 (or higher) to encrypt all of its traffic, and enable HSTS with a minimum age of one year.
3. An application must follow the “Principle of Least Privilege”, when requesting app scopes. This means that an application should only request scopes required to perform its intended functionality, and nothing more.
4. An application must securely store and manage secrets, which include OAuth tokens, sharedSecret, API keys, and encryption keys. They cannot be stored in places that are easily accessible. Examples of places include:

* Source code and code repository tools, such as Bitbucket and Github
* URL strings
* Referer headers
* Application logs

### Application security[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/publish/publishing-and-guidelines)

1. An application must maintain and securely configure domains where the application is hosted.
2. When applicable, an application must enable security headers and cookie security attributes.
3. An application must validate and sanitize all untrusted data and treat all user input as unsafe to mitigate injection-related vulnerabilities. Untrusted data is any input that can be manipulated to contain a web attack payload.
4. An application must not use versions of third-party libraries and dependencies with known critical or high vulnerabilities. When vulnerabilities in these libraries and dependencies are discovered, application developers must remediate them as quickly as possible.

### Privacy[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/publish/publishing-and-guidelines)

1. An application must not collect or store credentials belonging to CAKE.com user accounts such as user passwords or user API tokens.

### Vulnerability management[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/publish/publishing-and-guidelines)

1. You must notify CAKE.com of all security incidents via [support@cake.com](mailto:support@cake.com).
2. Your account email will be taken as a security contact where you’ll be notified about vulnerabilities in the app.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to our team at [support@cake.com](mailto:support@cake.com); we’re here to help.

# Publishing Guidelines & Best Practices[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/publish/publishing-and-guidelines.html)

To get published in the CAKE.com Marketplace, your add-on must meet our quality, security, and privacy standards:

* **Functionality**: Your add-on must work as described and improve the experience of using Pumble.
* **User clarity**: Be transparent about your add-on’s purpose, setup, and data use.
* **Branding**: Follow Pumble’s branding guidelines for a cohesive output.
* **Setup simplicity**: Your add-on should be easy to install and use.
* **Security & privacy**: Handle all user data responsibly and comply with our Security and Data privacy requirements.

Assets containing hate speech, harassment, violence, or malicious content will not be published. If harmful or prohibited content is added later and reported, it will be removed right away.

These guidelines are intended to supplement our [Terms of Use](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/terms.html), [Privacy Policy](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/privacy.html), [Security Requirements](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/publish/publishing-and-guidelines.html) and [Listing Agreement](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/cake-com-marketplace-listing-agreement.html). We strongly encourage you to review all of these documents. Our guidelines may evolve over time as our business grows and changes. If you have feedback or suggestions, feel free to reach out.

## Versioning & Updates[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/publish/publishing-and-guidelines.html)

All add-ons in the Pumble ecosystem start with version 1.0.0. As you improve and update your product:

* Submit new versions via the developer dashboard.
* Clearly number each version (e.g., 1.1.0 for major, 1.0.1 for minor updates).
* Each version goes through the review process again before going live.
* Once a new version is published, the previous version becomes outdated.

## Remove Add-ons or Versions[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/publish/publishing-and-guidelines.html)

How to remove your add-on or a specific version?

* Developers can delete draft or pending versions directly.
* Published versions require a support request.
* Once deletion begins, existing users are notified and the add-on will be permanently removed after 31 days.

## Why Build for Pumble?[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/publish/publishing-and-guidelines.html)

With custom Pumble add-ons, you can:

* Improve team workflows.
* Integrate third-party tools your team already uses.
* Reach thousands of teams using Pumble every day.

## Security requirements[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/publish/publishing-and-guidelines.html)

### Authentication & authorization[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/publish/publishing-and-guidelines.html)

An add-on must authenticate and authorize every request on all endpoints exposed. Anonymous access to application endpoints and resources can be allowed in scenarios where it is needed.

### Data protection[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/publish/publishing-and-guidelines.html)

1. Any CAKE.com End User Data stored by an application outside of the CAKE.com product or users’ browser must ensure full disk encryption at-rest. If accessed by an application or a service, it should be authenticated and authorized appropriately.
2. An application must use TLS version 1.2 (or higher) to encrypt all of its traffic, and enable HSTS with a minimum age of one year.
3. An application must follow the “Principle of Least Privilege”, when requesting app scopes. This means that an application should only request scopes required to perform its intended functionality, and nothing more.
4. An application must securely store and manage secrets, which include OAuth tokens, sharedSecret, API keys, and encryption keys. They cannot be stored in places that are easily accessible. Examples of places include:

* Source code and code repository tools, such as Bitbucket and Github
* URL strings
* Referer headers
* Application logs

### Application security[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/publish/publishing-and-guidelines.html)

1. An application must maintain and securely configure domains where the application is hosted.
2. When applicable, an application must enable security headers and cookie security attributes.
3. An application must validate and sanitize all untrusted data and treat all user input as unsafe to mitigate injection-related vulnerabilities. Untrusted data is any input that can be manipulated to contain a web attack payload.
4. An application must not use versions of third-party libraries and dependencies with known critical or high vulnerabilities. When vulnerabilities in these libraries and dependencies are discovered, application developers must remediate them as quickly as possible.

### Privacy[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/publish/publishing-and-guidelines.html)

1. An application must not collect or store credentials belonging to CAKE.com user accounts such as user passwords or user API tokens.

### Vulnerability management[#](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/pumble/publish/publishing-and-guidelines.html)

1. You must notify CAKE.com of all security incidents via [support@cake.com](mailto:support@cake.com).
2. Your account email will be taken as a security contact where you’ll be notified about vulnerabilities in the app.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to our team at [support@cake.com](mailto:support@cake.com); we’re here to help.

***11.5. Usage Data.*** In addition to CAKE.com’s other rights, CAKE.com may collect certain data and information regarding your use of the Services, including data about calls and requests, Add-On metadata and the Add-On User accounts that you access (“Usage Data”). We may use Usage Data for any purpose in connection with operating, improving and supporting the Services.
Open-Source Software. Certain distributed code in the CAKE.com Tools (e.g., SDKs) may be licensed under or include components subject to “open source” software terms (“OSS”). To the extent applicable, CAKE.com will identify OSS included in the CAKE.com Tools in or through the Developer Portal itself. When you use the OSS as part of the Services, you must comply with these Terms.

***12. Limitations of Liability***

***12.1. General Limitation.*** NEITHER CAKE.com NOR ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES WILL BE LIABLE TO DEVELOPER OR ANY OF DEVELOPER’S REPRESENTATIVES FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR OTHER SPECIAL DAMAGES SUFFERED BY DEVELOPER OR ANY OF DEVELOPER’S REPRESENTATIVES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF, FOR ANY AND ALL CAUSES OF ACTION OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING TORT, CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY AND BREACH OF WARRANTY) EVEN IF CAKE.com OR ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIVE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DAMAGES ARE FORESEEABLE.

***12.1. Liability Cap.*** THE ENTIRE LIABILITY OF CAKE.com AND ITS REPRESENTATIVES COLLECTIVELY UNDER, OR WITH RESPECT TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF, THESE TERMS, SHALL NOT EXCEED, IN THE AGGREGATE, ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS (USD $100).

***12.3. Basis of Bargain; Failure of Essential Purpose.*** The parties have entered into these Terms relying on the limitations of liability, disclaimers of warranty and other provisions relating to allocation of risk stated in these Terms and agree that such provisions are an essential basis of the bargain between the parties.

***13. Dispute Resolution; Governing Law***

***13.1. Informal Resolution.*** In the event of any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms, the parties will consult and negotiate with each other and, recognizing their mutual interests, attempt to reach a solution satisfactory to both parties. If the parties do not reach settlement within a period of sixty (60) days, either party may pursue relief as may be available under these Terms pursuant to Section 13.2 (Governing Law; Jurisdiction). All negotiations pursuant to this Section 13.1 will be confidential and treated as compromise and settlement negotiations for purposes of all similar rules and codes of evidence of applicable legislation and jurisdictions.

***13.2. Governing Law; Jurisdiction.*** These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the applicable laws of the State of California, USA, without giving effect to the principles of that State relating to conflicts of laws. Each party irrevocably agrees that any legal action, suit or proceeding arising out of or related to these Terms must be brought solely and exclusively in, and will be subject to the service of process and other applicable procedural rules of, the State or Federal courts in San Jose in Santa Clara County, California, USA, and each party irrevocably submits to the sole and exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts in San Jose in Santa Clara County, California, USA, generally and unconditionally, with respect to any action, suit or proceeding brought by it or against it by the other party.

***13.3. Injunctive Relief; Enforcement.*** Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 13.1 (Informal Resolution) and Section 13.2 (Governing Law; Jurisdiction), nothing in these Terms will prevent CAKE.com from seeking injunctive relief with respect to a violation of intellectual property rights, any Incident or other security issue, confidentiality obligations or enforcement or recognition of any award or order in any appropriate jurisdiction.

***13.4. Exclusion of UN Convention and UCITA.*** The terms of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the Sale of Goods do not apply to these Terms. The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) will not apply to these Terms regardless of when or where adopted.

***14. General.***

These Terms do not, and shall not be construed to, create any partnership, joint venture, employer-employee, agency or franchisor-franchisee relationship between you and CAKE.com. If any provision of these Terms is found to be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provision. The word “including” will be interpreted without limitation when used in these Terms. Each party will bear its own costs and expenses in performing its rights and obligations under these Terms. CAKE.com’s failure to enforce any provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of CAKE.com’s rights to subsequently enforce the provision. CAKE.com may freely assign, transfer and delegate its rights and obligations under these Terms. You acknowledge and agree that CAKE.com’s affiliates, contractors and service providers may exercise all rights of CAKE.com under these Terms. You may not assign any of your rights or obligations under these Terms, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without CAKE.com’s prior written consent, except that you may assign all of your rights and obligations under these Terms to any corporation or other entity without consent in connection with a merger or the sale of all or substantially all of your assets as long as (1) you give CAKE.com written notice of any such assignment at least ten (1) business days before such assignment and (2) the assignee agrees in writing to be bound by all terms and conditions of these Terms; however, in the event that CAKE.com determines that such assignment is to a competitor of CAKE.com, CAKE.com may terminate these Terms upon notice to you. Subject to the foregoing limitations, these Terms will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to its subject matter, supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous agreements between the parties with respect to its subject matter, and does not give any third party (except where specified) any rights or remedies hereunder. Any notice or other communication to be given hereunder will be in writing and given by you via email to [support@cake.com](mailto:support@cake.com) and by us to you by posting on our website or by email to the most recent email address that we have on file for you. The date of receipt will, in the case of email, be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.

echo "$m2" > ~/.m2/settings.xmlAddon SDK is a framework that is written in Java and offers abstractions to get up and running with the development of addons for the CAKE.com marketplace.

The SDK is intended to be easy to use and intuitive.

More features are planned and will be added to the SDK.

## Installation
Maven must be configured as described <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-apache-maven-registry#authenticating-to-github-packages">here</a>
before the Addons SDK can be installed.

Once you have configured the required settings, you can import the Addons SDK into your project by adding
the following dependency to your pom.xml file:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.cake.clockify</groupId>
    <artifactId>addon-sdk</artifactId>
    <version>${addonssdk.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

## Project
The project is organized in two modules:
- the annotation processor
- the addon SDK

## Annotation processor
The annotation processor module is only used at build-time. It generates helper interfaces based on the manifest schema.

Clockify manifest makes use of the ```@ExtendClockifyManifest``` annotation in order to let the annotation processor know
that it should generate interfaces for this class's builder according the specified definition.

For instance, suppose we have the following definition inside the json schema:
```json
"definitions": {
    "lifecycle": {
      "properties": {
        "path": {...},
        "type": {
          "enum": [
            "INSTALLED",
            "DELETED",
            "SETTINGS_UPDATED"
          ]
        }
      },
      "required": [...]
    }
    ...
}
```

The annotation processor will generate the following interfaces:
```java
public interface ClockifyLifecycleEventBuilderPathStep {
    ClockifyLifecycleEventBuilderTypeStep path(String value);
}

public interface ClockifyLifecycleEventBuilderTypeStep {
    ClockifyLifecycleEventBuilderBuildStep type(String value);

    default ClockifyLifecycleEventBuilderBuildStep onInstalled() {
        return type ("INSTALLED");
    }

    default ClockifyLifecycleEventBuilderBuildStep onDeleted() {
        return type ("DELETED");
    }

    default ClockifyLifecycleEventBuilderBuildStep onSettingsUpdated() {
        return type ("SETTINGS_UPDATED");
    }
}

public interface ClockifyLifecycleEventBuilderBuildStep {
    ClockifyLifecycleEvent build();
}
```

The above interfaces will result in a straightforward step-builder implementation.

Each required property will have its own step, and each step will only be able to set one property.
```java
ClockifyLifecycleEvent lifecycle = ClockifyLifecycleEvent
                .builder()
                .path("/lifecycle")
                .onInstalled()
                .build();
```


## Addon SDK
The SDK is structured into two parts, the shared codebase and the product-specific codebase:
- shared
- clockify, pumble, plaky

The product-specific layers will allow for more granular configuration and validation as well as provide specific helper classes.

### Features
- Predefined POJO models
- Product specific validation & helpers
- Centralized definition and handling of all the components of the addon
- Easy to get started by either relying on the embedded webserver or serving the provided servlet class through a web framework

### Getting started
First, create an addon instance:
```java
ClockifyAddon clockifyAddon = new ClockifyAddon(
        ClockifyManifest.v1_2Builder()
        .key(key)
        .name(name)
        .baseUrl(baseUrl)
        .requireBasicPlan()
        .scopes(List.of(
            ClockifyScope.PROJECT_READ,
            ClockifyScope.PROJECT_WRITE
        ))
        .build()
        );
```

The baseUrl must be a full URI, with the scheme, host and path.

Then, register any webhook / lifecycle / component / setting or custom endpoints on the addon.

Each object has its own builder class which by using the step builder pattern guides through the instantiation of the object and makes it easy to distinguish between required and optional properties.
```java
 ClockifyComponent component = ClockifyComponent
        .builder()
        .activityTab()
        .allowAdmins()
        .path("/component")
        .options(Map.of("opt1", "val1"))
        .build();

ClockifySetting number = ClockifySetting.builder()
        .id("id")
        .name("name")
        .asNumber()
        .value(12)
        .build();

ClockifySetting multipleSetting = ClockifySetting.builder()
        .id("id")
        .name("name")
        .asDropdownMultiple()
        .value(List.of("1", "2"))
        .allowedValues(List.of("1", "2", "3"))
        .build();


RequestHandler<HttpRequest> handler = new RequestHandler() { ... }
clockifyAddon.registerComponent(component, handler);
...
```

Addon-specific filters can be registered for requests that will be handled through the addon's servlet.
```java
Filter filter = ...; // servlet filter
clockifyAddon.addFilter(filter);
```

### Validating Clockify tokens
[https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/development-toolkit/authentication-and-authorization/](https://dev-docs.marketplace.cake.com/development-toolkit/authentication-and-authorization/)

ClockifySignatureParser can be used to verify that the received tokens have been signed by Clockify:
```java
RSAPublicKey publicKey = ...;
ClockifySignatureParser parser = new ClockifySignatureParser("{manifest-key}", publicKey);

String token = ...;
Map<String, Object> claims = parser.parseClaims(token);
String workspaceId = (String) claims.get(ClockifySignatureParser.CLAIM_WORKSPACE_ID);
```

### Serving the addon
#### Using the embedded jetty server
```java
AddonServlet servlet = new AddonServlet(clockifyAddon);
EmbeddedServer server = new EmbeddedServer(servlet);
server.start(port);
```
#### Serving via spring boot (or any other framework)

```java
import addonsdk.shared.Addon;
import addonsdk.shared.AddonServlet;

@WebServlet(...)
public class AppServlet extends AddonServlet {

    public AppServlet(Addon addon) {
        super(addon);
    }
}
```

## Documentation
### Manifest
The central part of an addon is its manifest. The manifest defines the basic information related to the addon, as well as the components and the routes that it supports.

A handler is automatically registered on the GET '/manifest' path when an addon object is instantiated.

When invoked, this handler will return a JSON containing the serialized manifest.

### Handlers
The following arguments are required when registering a handler:
- the HTTP method
- the relative path
- the handler itself

If the handler is being registered through either a component / lifecycle / webhook, the inferred HTTP method will depend on the type of the object itself.
- component -> GET
- lifecycle -> POST
- webhook -> POST

Each addon implementation will only accept its own component / lifecycle / webhook subclasses.name: Publish SDK

    "description": "## Introduction\nBy using this REST API, you can easily integrate Clockify with your own add-ons, push and pull data\nbetween Clockify and other tools, and create custom add-ons on [CAKE.com Marketplace](https://marketplace.cake.com).\nWhether you\u2019re looking to automate time tracking, generate custom reports, or build other custom\nintegrations, our API provides the flexibility and power you need to get the job done. If you\nhave any questions or run into any issues while using our API, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to us for help.\nYou can also post questions on Stack Overflow with the Clockify tag to get help from the community.\n## Authentication\nTo authenticate your requests to your API, make sure to include either the \u2018X-Api-Key\u2019 or the\n\u2018X-Addon-Token\u2019 in the request header, containing your API or Addon key. If your workspace is\non a subdomain (e.g. subdomain.clockify.me), you\u2019ll need to generate a new API key in your\nProfile Settings that will work specifically for that workspace. This ensures that you\u2019re\naccessing data from the correct workspace and helps maintain the security of your data.\n## Webhooks\nWebhooks can enhance your workflow by keeping your add-on up-to-date with the latest changes in\nClockify. With Clockify\u2019s webhooks you can receive real-time notifications when certain events such as\nstarting timer or deleting time entry occur in Clockify. Workspace admins can create up to 10 webhooks\neach, with a total of 100 webhooks allowed per workspace.\n## Rate limiting\nOur REST API has a specific rate limit of 50 requests per second (by addon on one workspace) when\naccessed using X-Addon-Token. Exceeding this limit will result in an error message with the description\n\"Too many requests\".\n## API URLs\nRefer to the list on what URL to use base on the subdomain and data region settings of your workspace.\n* Global - can be used by workspaces with or without subdomain.\n    * Regular: https://api.clockify.me/api/v1/file/image\n    * PTO: https://pto.api.clockify.me/v1/workspaces/{workspaceId}/policies\n    * Reports: https://reports.api.clockify.me/v1/workspaces/{workspaceId}/reports/detailed\n* Regional\n    * Non-subdomain\n        * Regular: https://euc1.clockify.me/api/v1/file/image\n        * PTO: https://use2.api.clockify.me/pto/v1/workspaces/{workspaceId}/policies\n        * Reports: https://use2.clockify.me/report/v1/workspaces/{workspaceId}/reports/detailed\n    * Subdomain\n        * Regular: https://euc1.clockify.me/api/v1/file/image\n        * PTO: https://yoursubdomainname.clockify.me/pto/v1/workspaces/{workspaceId}/policies\n        * Reports: https://yoursubdomainname.clockify.me/report/v1/workspaces/{workspaceId}/reports/detailed\n## Regional Server Prefixes\nIf your workspace is in a specific region, you need to change your URL prefix to access v1 API endpoints.\nFor example, this is how **backend** api [v1/file/image](#tag/User/operation/uploadImage) endpoint\nwould look in EU region:\n[https://euc1.clockify.me/api/v1/file/image](https://euc1.clockify.me)\n\nBelow are the available regional server prefixes:\n* **EU (Germany)**: euc1\n* **USA**: use2\n* **UK**: euw2\n* **AU**: apse2\n\n\n## Breaking changes\nBreaking changes in APIs are modifications that disrupt existing integrations,\nrequiring users to update their applications to maintain functionality.\nThese changes can lead to failures or unexpected results if not addressed.\nSee the list of [breaking changes](/breaking-changes/).\n\n## Experimental APIs\nThe experimental API has been thoroughly tested and is ready for use in production. However, please note that user feedback may lead to changes in the API\u2019s structure or functionality. If you choose to use the experimental API, be prepared to modify your application code accordingly to accommodate any updates.",

      "description": "This section provides a step-by-step guide that shows you how to use the Entity Changes API to keep your system up to date with time entry data, including custom field values, without re-downloading everything each time.\n\n> ### \ud83d\udca1 Note\n> Currently, this guide covers only one use case (custom field changes), but we plan to add more in the future.  \n\n# Use Case: Keep Custom Field Values in Sync - Entity Changes Based on Detailed Report\n\nThis use case describes how to retrieve a full set of data (via the Detailed Report), then use incremental updates of custom fields or [other supported types](#tag/Entity-Changes:-Use-cases/%22Use-Case:-Keep-Custom-Field-Values-in-Sync-Entity-Changes-Based-on-Detailed-Report%22/Supported-types) to stay in sync, including new, updated or deleted records.  \n\n## Step 1: Get Initial Data Using the Detailed Report\n\nStart by fetching time entries for a specified date range using the Detailed Report API. This is your baseline data (base dataset). \n\nBelow is an example that fetches data from `May 1 to May 20, 2025`.\n\nExample: Get data from May 1 to May 20, 2025.\n\n  * **Use the `curl` command below:**\n```\ncurl --location 'http://localhost:9090/workspaces/{WORKSPACE_ID}/reports/detailed' \\\n--header 'Accept: application/json' \\\n--data '{\n    \"dateRangeStart\": \"2025-05-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"dateRangeEnd\": \"2025-05-20T23:59:59.999Z\"\n}'\n```\n\n  * **Sample response:**\n```json\n    {\n      \"timeentries\": [\n        {\n          \"_id\": \"1\",\n          \"description\": \"Time entry 1\",\n          \"timeInterval\": {\n            \"start\": \"2025-05-18T01:00:00Z\",\n            \"end\": \"2025-05-18T09:00:00.000Z\"\n          },\n          \"customFields\": [\n            {\n              \"customFieldId\": \"6808e9a6b77db953ea0d3f73\",\n              \"value\": \"custom field value 1\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"_id\": \"2\",\n          \"description\": \"Time entry 2\",\n          \"timeInterval\": {\n            \"start\": \"2025-05-19T01:00:00Z\",\n            \"end\": \"2025-05-19T09:00:00.000Z\"\n          },\n          \"customFields\": [\n            {\n              \"customFieldId\": \"6808e9a6b77db953ea0d3f73\",\n              \"value\": \"Custom field value 2\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n```\n\nThe response contains a list of time entries with all current custom field values. \nSave this in your database. You\u2019ll use it to apply future changes\n\n> ### \ud83d\udca1 Note\n> After this, you don\u2019t need to fetch the full report again. Simply use the following steps to apply the changes.  \n\n## Step 2: Retrieve Created Custom Field Values\n\nFetch any new custom field values added after the date range you fetched in Step 1.\n\nExample: Get newly created values after May 20, 2025.\n\n> ### \ud83d\udca1 Note\n> For the API specification see Created entities - Custom field values.\nFor API specification see [Created entities - Custom field values ](#tag/Entity-changes-(Experimental)/operation/getCreatedEntityInfo)\n\n\n* **Use the `curl` command below:**\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET\n\"http://localhost:8080/v1/workspaces/{WORKSPACE_ID}/entities/created?type=TIME_ENTRY_CUSTOM_FIELD_VALUE&start=2025-05-21T00:00:00Z&end=2025-05-22T00:00:00Z&limit=30&page=1\"\n```\n* **Sample response:**\n```json\n  [\n    {\n      \"auditMetadata\": {\n        \"updatedAt\": \"2025-05-21T04:00:00Z\",\n        \"createdAt\": \"2025-05-21T03:00:00Z\"\n      },\n      \"documentType\": \"TIME_ENTRY_CUSTOM_FIELD_VALUE\",\n      \"id\": \"...\",\n      \"customFieldId\": \"6808e9a6b77db953ea0d3f85\",\n      \"timeEntryId\": \"3\",\n      \"value\": \"Custom field value 3\"\n        \"sourceType\": \"TIMEENTRY\"\n    }\n  ]\n```\n\nThe response shows only newly created custom field values. \n\nEach record has a timeEntryId, so you know which entry to update.\n\nAdd these new values to your stored data.\n\n> ### \ud83d\udca1 Note\n> Run this daily, weekly, or as often as your app needs updates.\n\n\n## Step 3: Retrieve Updated Custom Field Values\n**Next**, fetch custom field values that were updated after your original data.\n\nExample: Get updates after May 20, 2025.\n\n> ### \ud83d\udca1 Note\n> For API specification see Updated entities - [Updated entities - Custom field values ](#tag/Entity-changes-(Experimental)/operation/getUpdatedEntityInfo)     \n\n  * **Use the `curl` command below:**\n\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET\n\"http://localhost:8080/v1/workspaces/{WORKSPACE_ID}/entities/updated?type=TIME_ENTRY_CUSTOM_FIELD_VALUE&start=2025-05-21T00:00:00Z&end=2025-05-22T00:00:00Z&limit=30&page=1\"\n```\n* **Sample response:**\n```json\n  [\n    {\n      \"auditMetadata\": {\n        \"updatedAt\": \"2025-05-21T04:51:20Z\",\n        \"createdAt\": \"2025-05-19T04:51:10Z\"\n      },\n      \"documentType\": \"TIME_ENTRY_CUSTOM_FIELD_VALUE\",\n      \"id\": \"...\",\n      \"customFieldId\": \"6808e9a6b77db953ea0d3f73\",\n      \"timeEntryId\": \"2\",\n      \"value\": \"Custom field value 2 - Updated\"\n        \"sourceType\": \"TIMEENTRY\"\n    }\n  ]\n```\nThe response shows only updated values within the specified date range. \n\nUpdates are linked to their timeEntryId.\n\nUpdate the matching records in your database.\n\n> ### \ud83d\udca1 Note\n>  If a record was both created and updated in the same date range, it will only appear in the /created response, not /updated.\n\n## Step 4: Retrieve or Identify Deleted Custom Field Values\nFinally, handle deletions. Use this step to remove any custom field values that were deleted after your initial data range. \n\nExample: Get deletions after May 20, 2025.\n\n> ### \ud83d\udca1 Note\n> For more information about this API, see [Deleted entities - Custom field values ](#tag/Entity-changes-(Experimental)/operation/getDeletedEntityInfo)\n\n* **Use the `curl` command below:**\n```\ncurl -X GET \"http://localhost:8080/v1/workspaces/{WORKSPACE_ID}/entities/deleted?type=TIME_ENTRY_CUSTOM_FIELD_VALUE&start=2025-05-21T00:00:00Z&end=2025-05-22T00:00:00Z&limit=30&page=1\"\n```\n\n* **Sample response:**\n```json\n  [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"...\",\n      \"deletionBinId\": \"....\",\n      \"deletedAt\": \"2025-05-21T23:15:54.790Z\",\n      \"documentType\": \"TIME_ENTRY_CUSTOM_FIELD_VALUE\",\n      \"document\": {\n        \"customFieldId\": \"6808e9a6b77db953ea0d3f73\",\n        \"timeEntryId\": \"1\",\n        \"value\": \"custom field value 1\",\n        \"sourceType\": \"TIMEENTRY\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n```\n\nThe response contains references to the deleted values (e.g. timeEntryId and field ID). \n\nRemove or archive these records in your system.\n\n> ### \ud83d\udca1 Note \n> If a value was created and deleted in the same date range, it will not show up in the deleted results.\n\n## Supported types\n\n  This guide focuses on tracking custom field values `(type=TIME_ENTRY_CUSTOM_FIELD_VALUE)`.\n\n  The same approach can be applied to other data types. Simply change the type parameter in your requests and you can use the same steps for these other supported types:\n\n  * `TIME_ENTRY`\n  * `TIME_ENTRY_RATE`\n  * `TIME_ENTRY_CUSTOM_FIELD_VALUE`\n\n  We may support more types in the future as the system evolves.\n",

}# Clockify UI Kit / Storybook

- Entry point: https://resources.developer.clockify.me/ui/latest/showcase/?path=/story/introduction--page
- Saved snapshot: `extras/ui-kit-storybook.html` (shell page; Storybook content loads via dynamic assets).

If you need component names/props programmatically, fetch the Storybook JSON index (often `sb.json` or `index.json`) from the same base. Note: direct JSON fetch returned 403 from this environment. Using a browser or a headless runtime with proper headers may be required to retrieve it.

# Maven Setup for Clockify Add-on SDK

- Registry: `https://maven.pkg.github.com/clockify/addon-java-sdk`
- Dependency coordinates: `com.cake.clockify:addon-sdk:<version>`
- Auth docs: https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-apache-maven-registry#authenticating-with-a-personal-access-token

Add GitHub Packages repository to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<repositories>
   <repository>
       <id>github</id>
       <url>https://maven.pkg.github.com/clockify/addon-java-sdk</url>
   </repository>
</repositories>
```

Add the SDK dependency:

```xml
<dependencies>
   <dependency>
       <groupId>com.cake.clockify</groupId>
       <artifactId>addon-sdk</artifactId>
       <version>1.4.0</version>
   </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

Optional helper to create `~/.m2/settings.xml` with GitHub token: `extras/addon-java-sdk/configure-maven.sh`.
